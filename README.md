A simple application for weebs, made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Or maybe you didn't like the line that you are reading right now and want to change it! Well, why not?

We appreciate all kinds of contributions from core-code contributions to non-code contributions like fixing the site, suggesting a feature, raising an issue, etc.


## How to Contribute?

- Pick the character you want to contribute, and make sure it's not there on the site yet (Use the Search feature)
- `Fork` the repository
- Download your favourite character's image and upload it to the `images` folder. Make sure you provide a valid name for your image file
- Copy the Card template code given below & fill in the information as directed
- Note: Copy & paste the entire code as it is after filling in the details of the character!
<!--Sample [Character Name] card start-->
                <div class="card mb-3 card-bg my-4" style="max-width: 100%;">
                    <div class="row no-gutters">
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                        <!-- Replace image_name_here with the complete name (with extension) of the image you uploaded -->
                            <img src="./images/[image_name_here]" alt="[Character Name here]" height="390px" width="300px">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-8">
                            <div class="card-body">
                                <h2 class="card-title">[Character Name]</h2>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                  [Character Description 1 Here]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  [Character Description 2 Here]
                                </p>
                                <hr>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <!--Sample [Character Name] card end-->
                <!--Add your card below this line -->
