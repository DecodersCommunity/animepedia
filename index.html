                                series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive, strong-willed, and occasionally
                                simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha (or Leaf Village).</p>
                            <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's
                                chakra, which is much greater than the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated
                                each other, and would rarely grant Naruto his power
                                unless they were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers
                                to the fox by his name, Kurama. At this point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.

                                anime/manga series and the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime/manga series. He is
                                currently the Kazekage of Sunagakure (Hidden Sand Village) in Naruto Shippuden.
                                He was formerly a villain in the early part of Naruto, being a threat in the Chunnin
                                Exams. He was a misanthrope due to discrimination and isolation he experienced in
                                childhood because the Shukaku, or the One-Tailed Demon
                                sealed inside of him. His hatred was extinguished by Naruto Uzumaki upon his defeat. As
                                the current Kazekage, he administrates and protects his village. Gaara is also the
                                youngest to be ever to become Kazekage. He occasionally
                                assists Naruto or the Hidden Leaf in general. </p>
                            <p>He can control sand and his ninja techniques are mainly sand based. He was captured by
                                the Akatsuki and extracted Shukaku by using the Gedo Statue as result of his death until
                                he was revived by Chiyo with the reincarnation
                                ninjutsu in exchange for her to die. While forming the Allied Shinobi Forces, Gaara
                                became commander of the Fourth Division as well as the commander-in-chief of the forces.
                                After the Fourth Shinobi War, he remained as the
                                Kazekage and adopted Shinki as a son to control his Iron Sand that was created by the
                                Third Kazekage. He is voiced by Akira Ishida in the Japanese version of the anime, and

                                Academia. She is a student at U.A. High School training to become a Pro Hero. She is one
                                of Izuku Midoriya's closest friends. She is voiced by Ayane Sakura in the Japanese
                                version of the anime, and by Luci Christian in the English version.

                                As a hero, her heroine identity is Uravity (ウラビティ Urabiti) and her quirk is Zero
                                Gravity, a power to manipulate gravity in ways such as making objects weightless or
                                making objects float, or even make herself to fly. However, her quirk still has a
                                limitation.
                                A drawback to this Quirk that if it is used too much (around three tons) or if she makes
                                herself float, she will suffer from nausea and possibly vomit as a result. Her hero
                                costume is made to minimize this negative effect
                                when she uses her quirk. For training, Ochaco placed herself into a plastic sphere and
                                tumbled down a mountain, in order to adjust her inner ear canals to Zero Gravity as well
                                as to reduce the after effects of nausea, all
                                while increasing how much weight she can lift.

                                Satoru Gojo is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a
                                special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world.
                                Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless
                                and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High
                                and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.

                                Satoru is a tall man with a lean build in his later twenties who is considered
                                relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the
                                Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black
                                blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. When sporting a
                                more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of
                                his neck. While working, Satoru wears a dark
                                blue zip-up jacket with a high collar that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit
                                matching black pants and black dress boots.

                                Akuto has an incredible amount of power within him that sometimes gets out of control.
                                Akuto has a highly serious personality but not without some humor. In the manga, he has
                                much more of a temper, and, in a fight, is unwilling to hold anything back.
                                In the anime, he tries to restrain himself in order to convince everyone that he has no
                                desire to be the Demon King. Powers: Akuto is capable of controlling and manipulating
                                "mana", a magical energy that resides in the
                                bodies of living things and in surroundings. For instance, he is able to absorb the mana
                                of a large demon dog, thus transforming it back into a normal puppy, a feat that has
                                never been performed before. However, his immense
                                power is also highly volatile and most of his early attempts at controlling mana and
                                creating magical projectiles, no matter how benign they are supposed to be, resulted in
                                catastrophic explosions. His name is phonetically
                                very similar to a Japanese phrase meaning "Great/Ultimate villain".

                                Brock, known as Takeshi (タケシ) in Japan, is a fictional character in the Pokémon
                                franchise owned by Nintendo. In the Pokémon video games, he is the Gym Leader of Pewter
                                City and mainly uses Rock-type Pokémon. In the anime series, Ash comes across a man
                                that is later revealed to be Brock's father.

                                Brock had to take care of his many, many siblings and could not leave. This is why he
                                became a gym leader, to stay close to his family. His father comes back and states
                                that he will take care of the family. Brock left his position as a Gym Leader to travel
                                alongside Ash Ketchum and became a revered Pokémon breeder. He later cultivates his
                                skill in medicine, and goes to Pewter City in order
                                to train and become a Pokémon doctor. He has also appeared in several Pokémon manga
                                series, including Pokémon Adventures and the Ash & Pikachu manga.

				    Escanoris the Lion's Sin of Pride「傲慢の罪ライオン・シン, Raion Shin」 of the Seven 
				    Deadly Sins, the former second prince of the Kingdom of Castellio, and the
				    man known throughout the Kingdom of Liones as "The Strongest Holy Knight".
				    His Sacred Treasure is the Divine Axe, Rhitta, and his inherent power is called
				    Sunshine, which made him renowned for gaining immense power during the day, and
				    gradually becoming weaker with the setting of the sun, leaving him frail and
				    submissive at night.
				<p>
				    Escanor's personality changes drastically along with his strength between day
				    and night. At night, he is skittish, submissive and unfailingly polite. Whereas
				    in the day he is arrogant, boastful, and domineering, he also takes it upon
				    himself to deliver judgment to those he feels have sinned, such as those that toy
				    with feelings. Both personalities seem to be truly him, and he remembers everything
				    he does in either, though at night he has chastised himself for losing control during
				    the day.

                                Lelouch was one of the best examples of a hero gone astray. As often happens in dramatic
                                stories, his good intentions paved a road to a dark place. His rise and downfall is
                                almost Shakespearean in nature, as his own pride and arrogance cloud his judgment
                                and he misses out on what was truly important. But at least he did it all with a sense
                                of dramatic flair! His alter ego Zero, complete with mysterious helmet and flowing cape,
                                was an iconic tool to secure a place in the
                                psyche of both his enemies and his followers. In the end, Lelouch's plans are
                                successful, though not in the way anyone ever expected.

                                several writers, although some have considered his initial appearance to be
                                unsurprising.

                                Garou (ガロウ, Garō; Viz: Garo) is a villain, a martial arts prodigy, the self-proclaimed
                                "Hero Hunter," and a major adversary of the Hero Association and Monster Association. He
                                is a disciple of Bang and was once expelled from his dojo for going on a rampage.[9]
                                Because of his fascination with monsters, he is commonly called the "Human
                                Monster."[10][11] Sitch of the Hero Association views him as a grave threat to the
                                organization despite being only a human.

                                Bang, who has retired from being a hero and is intending for Garou to fill the hole he
                                has left.

                                Obito Uchiha (うちはオビト，Uchiha Obito) was a member of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. He was
                                believed to have died during the Third Shinobi World War, his only surviving legacy
                                being the Sharingan he gave to his teammate, Kakashi Hatake.

                                In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara, but the events of the war
                                left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an ideal
                                world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ，Tobi) and Madara Uchiha himself,
                                Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance his
                                machinations, eventually going public and starting the Fourth Shinobi World War.

                                the world, a fact complimented by having
                                the highest active bounty whilst alive, and the second highest bounty of any pirate in

                                Rock Lee (ロック・リー, Rokku Rī) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Lee clan and a member of Team
                                Guy. Unlike most shinobi, he lacked the skills necessary to use ninjutsu or genjutsu.
                                However, he overcomes those shortcomings by undergoing special training from
                                Might Guy that would make him a taijutsu master while still a genin.

                                Under Guy's leadership, Lee has acquired a number of his sensei's personality traits: he
                                is energetic, optimistic, and hot-blooded, and shows the epitome of a "nice guy". He
                                believes that one cannot dislike food and shows strong dedication to his promises;
                                when this promise is broken, just barely, he assigns himself arduous training to prevent
                                it from happening again.

                                Hashirama Senju (千手柱間, Senju Hashirama) was a member of the famed Senju clan. He himself
                                was hailed as the "God of Shinobi" for his unmatched ninja prowess. Hashirama sought
                                peace for the shinobi world, and to that end founded Konohagakure with his clan,
                                his childhood friend and rival: Madara Uchiha and the Uchiha clan. He would later become
                                the First Hokage (初代火影, Shodai Hokage, literally meaning: First or Founding Fire Shadow)
                                of Konohagakure. Although he was not able
                                to achieve peace during his lifetime, his legacy and vision for the world would continue
                                to shape the village and the entire shinobi world even after his death.
                            </p>

                                Hashirama was born during the Warring States Period, the eldest of Butsuma Senju's four
                                sons. Hashirama and his brothers grew up on the battlefield waging constant war with the
                                Senju's rivals: the Uchiha. During his infrequent downtime, Hashirama met
                                a boy his own age named Madara.

                                Kai Hiwatari (火渡カイ Hiwatari Kai) is one of the deuteragonists from the Original Series,
                                consisting of Beyblade, Beyblade: V-Force and Beyblade: G-Revolution. He is the former
                                leader of the Blade Sharks and current leader of the G Revolutions (English
                                dub only). He is also a former member of the Blitzkrieg Boys. His Bit-Beast and Beyblade
                                is Dranzer - one of the 4 Sacred Bit-Beasts.

                                Kai is a proud and a very confident blader who is willing to sacrifice everything to get
                                what he wants. He doesn't mind crushing people on the way up though he would much prefer
                                earning things through hard work. He doesn't like to lose and feels frustrated
                                and upset whenever he does. However, when he returns to his old self, he does so with an
                                even stronger determination to win. This is a trait he shares with his Phoenix
                                Bit-Beast, Suzaku. He is a quiet and mysterious person.

                                Near (ニア, Nia) is the younger of L's two successors, raised in Wammy's House—Watari's
                                orphanage for gifted children in Winchester, England. After L's death, Near begins his
                                investigation of the Kira case, gathering evidence over a period of four years.
                                Near takes his findings to the President of the United States and reveals himself to be
                                the true successor of L. Soon after, Near becomes the head of the Special Provision for
                                Kira and continues the hunt for Kira. After
                                making contact with "L" (Light Yagami), Near begins to suspect that he is also Kira.

                                Near is a young, slender, fair-skinned man with a petite build, gray eyes, and short,
                                shaggy platinum blonde hair which he often plays with. He is only seen wearing a white,
                                long-sleeved pajama top and white pajama pants. In the anime, Near's pants are
                                light blue. In the Death Note One-Shot Special, which takes place three years after the
                                end of the Kira case, Near is shown to have sharp bags under his eyes, slightly longer
                                hair, and to have undergone a growth spurt.
                                He sits in a posture similar to L's and is often seen being expressionless.

                                Boros (ボロス, Borosu), also called Lord Boros (ボロス様, Borosu-sama) by his subordinates, was

                                destruction of A-City. Like Saitama, Boros faced a self-imposed existential crisis,
                                having become so powerful that no battle thrilled him. His intergalactic travels in
                                search of a worthy opponent led him to Earth, where he was killed by Saitama.[4]

                                Because of his incredible power, Boros was both arrogant and prideful. Due to his love
                                of battles and his inability to find an opponent who has been able to match him in
                                power, he roamed the universe looking for worthy opponents that would be able to
                                stand against him. He was also extremely callous, indifferent to the destruction and
                                loss of life his invasion caused to A-City, and the destruction of his ship and the
                                death of most of his crew while fighting Saitama.

                                Quirkless, he manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero All Might,
                                due to his innate heroism and a strong sense of justice, and has since become his close
                                pupil, as well as a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School. All Might passed on his
                                transferable Quirk to Izuku, making him the ninth
                                holder of One For All.

                                Following the Paranormal Liberation War, with Tomura Shigaraki and All For One actively
                                targeting Izuku for his Quirk, he decides to leave U.A. before finishing his first year
                                to keep his classmates out of harm's way.[4] After encouragement from his friends,
                                he later returns to the school and leads the heroes against the villains in one final,
                                desperate battle to save the world.

                                In the early ’70s, anime was still gaining a foothold as a legitimate and profitable
                                form of entertainment. It was still largely seen as a vehicle for either dramatic
                                stories, or children's tales, but Lupin brought adult comedy anime into the forefront.
                                Although his adult-oriented themes took a while to catch on, eventually his lecherous
                                antics and suave handling of epic heists brought grown-ups firmly into anime and proved
                                to Japanese studio execs that this kind of title
                                could make them money. From Rome, to Paris, to Rio, Lupin traveled far and wide in
                                search of booty… both kinds. It was Lupin's love of women and his dirty mind that
                                provided much of the comedy in the series, and it was
                                the first time racy humor found itself in popular anime.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the most beautiful part of the anime version of Lupin is that he's much more
                                chivalrous than his manga counterpart. The anime version of the character was much more
                                appropriate for the times and fir his role as a leading man of anime.

                                Temari is one of the main supporting characters in the Naruto anime and manga series and
                                the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime and manga series. She is a jōnin-level
                                kunoichi of Sunagakure and one of the three Sand Siblings. Temari is the eldest child
                                and only daughter of the Fourth Kazekage, and the older sister of Kankuro and Gaara.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not being
                                afraid to speak her mind. One of the few things shown to intimidate her is her younger
                                brother Gaara. She very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding attitude,
                                when around the boy, due to the fear of Gaara's wrath. Temari does have a caring side,
                                and is not above showing concern for others. She is often seen with Shikamaru. Temari is
                                a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's
                                strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins. For actual combat she uses her
                                giant iron fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide
                                upon in order to intimidate her foes. Sometime after
                                The Fourth Shinobi War, Temari marries Shikamaru Nara and gave birth their first and
                                only son, Shikadai. She is voiced by Romi Park in the Japanese version of the anime who
                                also voiced Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist,
                                Tōshirō Hitsugaya, from Bleach. and by Tara Platt in the English version of the anime.

                                and the fact that she doesn't need to consume human blood to survive.

                                Shikamaru Nara (奈良 シカマル, Nara Shikamaru) is a fictional character in the manga and anime
                                franchise, Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto. In the anime and manga, Shikamaru is a
                                ninja affiliated with the village Hidden in the Leaves. He is a member of
                                Team 10, a group of ninja consisting of himself, Choji Akimichi, Ino Yamanaka, and team
                                leader Asuma Sarutobi. Shikamaru is portrayed as a lazy character, unwilling to apply
                                his prodigious intelligence.

                                Shikamaru Nara is one of the smartest characters in the anime manga series Naruto.
                                Masashi Kishimoto originally created Shikamaru in order for him to be the only winner of
                                an early Naruto arc: the Chunin Exams, based on his high intelligence. However,
                                recommendations from his editors resulted in Kishimoto deciding to interrupt the
                                fighting tournament between the ninjas in order to focus on a recently introduced
                                villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless, Shikamaru ends up becoming
                                the only ninja from the original test to achieve a higher rank during Part I of the
                                series.

                                Trunks has either blue[8][9][10] or lavender hair color and his mother's blue eyes. He
                                has his father's eye shape, facial features and tanned skin. Several characters, such as
                                Goku, Krillin and Bulma, remark how much Trunks resembles Vegeta. For the majority
                                of the Buu Saga, Present Trunks wears a dark green gi, an orange belt, orange wristbands
                                and the same golden boots that Future Trunks wears, he also wears this in the movie,
                                Bio-Broly. In the events of Broly - Second Coming,
                                Trunks wears a light green long sleeve hoodie with a black short sleeve undershirt with
                                a red collar, indigo blue denim shorts and his golden boots from his primary outfit.

                                Trunks is born in November of Age 766 to Vegeta and Bulma, thus making him a Saiyan and
                                Human hybrid, like Gohan. He was an illegitimate child due to the fact that he was
                                conceived as a result of a brief affair between his parents. In his infancy, he
                                was well-loved and doted on by his mother, but it appeared as if his father had little
                                to no parental emotions towards the boy due to the former never wanting to have children
                                and viewing hybrids as a disgrace. However,
                                after the end of the Cell Games, the relationship between his parents improved and they
                                got married, and they began raising Trunks as a family.

                                often going solo to root out the truth behind the cases she's working.

                                As a result, he is extremely self-aware and humble because he does not want to revert to
                                his old self. He is a kind person, helping his friends and protecting his family

                                along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth

                                by two Iwagakure Jonin. Obito wanted to rescue his teammate; But Kakashi said that the
                                mission came first. Kakashi found himself in the same situation as his father had been

                                of the series. He is the older twin brother of Nina Fortner (formerly known as Anna
                                Liebert) who was shot in the head in 1986, but he was operated on and saved from
                                death by Dr. Kenzo Tenma. Because of this, he is very grateful to Dr. Tenma and extends

                                to cause suffering and destruction for his pleasure. His original goal, as he states
                                when he is young, was to be the last one standing at the end of the world, though later

                                of this pursuit, to erase himself from the world and commit the perfect suicide.

                                Ever the reluctant fighter, Vash was a living contradiction. He's gifted with superhuman
                                fighting abilities, but also a superhuman capacity for compassion and kindness. He's a
                                character who suffered countless scars and wounds to his own body to protect
                                others, even the very villains he was trying to stop, and his vow to never take a life
                                provides plenty of drama in Trigun as his enemies use his virtue against him.

                                Vash is called "the humanoid typhoon" because utter destruction tends to follow him
                                wherever he goes, and there's a huge bounty on his head. But in reality, he's humanity's
                                secret guardian angel on the distant, wild planet of Gunsmoke. As a "Plant," he's
                                a being with power that few can comprehend. He's the greatest gunman on the planet, and
                                all the criminals he faces don't stand a chance against him. But Vash's true challenge
                                is in saving the world from his "brother" Knives,
                                and it's this conflict that brings out Vash's real heroism. The tale of Vash's childhood
                                and his mother figure Rem is a great story, as is the story of how Knives ended up being
                                the polar opposite of Vash. Although Vash

                                Nagato (長門, Nagato) was a shinobi of Amegakure and descendant of the Uzumaki clan.
                                Forming Akatsuki alongside his friends (and fellow war orphans) Yahiko and Konan, Nagato
                                dreamed of bringing peace to the violent shinobi world. However, following Yahiko's
                                death, Nagato adopted the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein) and, along with Konan, began leading
                                a new Akatsuki — one that would force the world into peace using any means necessary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nagato lived with his parents: Fusō and Ise on the outskirts of Amegakure. When he was
                                very young, Madara Uchiha secretly transplanted his Rinnegan into Nagato without his or
                                his parents' knowledge.[8] Sometime later, during the Second Shinobi World War,
                                Nagato and his parents took shelter in their home to avoid the fighting going on around
                                them.

                                (鳳凰院凶真, Hououin Kyōma), is a self-proclaimed mad scientist and the main protagonist of
                                the Steins;Gate series. Okabe has the characteristics of a lanky young man,
                                with a square jaw and bony cheeks.

                                In the game, Okabe appeared much "dustier". His face was pale and unshaven and he seemed
                                a lot more "messy" in contrast to his relatively "clean" appearance in the anime.

                                by two men in black later revealed to be members of the Black Organization. The poison
                                de-aged Shinichi's entire body except for his nervous system and therefore he still has

                                Sōma's main outfit is his Restaurant Yukihira cooking uniform, consisting of a black
                                shirt with the restaurant's logo on the back and left chest area of his shirt. Whenever
                                he cooks, he wears a white apron over his waist. While at Tōtsuki, Sōma wears
                                a black coat summer school uniform over his Yukihira cooking uniform. Sōma also ties his
                                trademark white headband around his forehead whenever he cooks. If he is not cooking or
                                bathing, he wears his headband around his
                                left wrist. Compared to his fellow Tōtsuki students, Sōma dresses very casually; in his
                                free time, he sports a hanten jacket with a simple white shirt beneath it and a striped
                                track pants at his places of residence. Sōma
                                states that dressing in his hanten calms him down.

                                and the only person Lelouch was unable to beat in chess as a child.Charismatic and
                                manipulative, cunning and ruthless, Schneizel is widely regarded as Lelouch's greatest

                                even Lelouch's. Despite this, he shows a caring side to his subordinates, earning their
                                respect and loyalty. His hierarchy in the Britannian family gives him great
                                power and influence; though he does have ambitions for the throne, a fact the Emperor
                                seems aware of but not concerned by.

                                Orochimaru (大蛇丸, Orochimaru) is one of Konohagakure's legendary Sannin. With a
                                life-ambition to learn all of the world's secrets, Orochimaru seeks immortality so that
                                he might live all of the lives necessary to accomplish his task. After being caught
                                red-handed performing unethical experiments on his fellow citizens for the sake of this
                                immortality, Orochimaru defected from Konoha rather than be persecuted for his
                                ambitions, and for many years sought the village's destruction
                                in order to take revenge and demonstrate what he had learned.

                                After several apparent deaths in the pursuit of his goals, Orochimaru realises his
                                approach is flawed through Kabuto Yakushi, his former associate, and begins monitoring
                                the choices and actions of his former apprentice, Sasuke Uchiha.

                                Anthy Himemiya (also known as Himemiya Ansh) is a mysterious girl who is considered to
                                be a girl who has no ideas or desires other than what her current master expects of her.
                                She often becomes the subject of other characters' fury because she tends to
                                act like a "doormat" and take what they want or desire. Her personality alternates
                                between unselfish love, passive-aggressive revenge, and taught helplessness. Her past
                                and present selves are tragic and spiteful. Anthy,
                                like Utena Tenjou, both defies and fits the preconceptions that she represents as both a
                                princess and a witch.

                                Anthy seems to be South Asian and perhaps of Indian ancestry. She wears a bindi mark or
                                jewel and is notably darker than the others.

                                Boruto Uzumaki (うずまきボルト, Uzumaki Boruto) is a shinobi from Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan
                                and a direct descendant of the Hyūga clan through his mother. While initially resentful
                                of his father and his absence since becoming Hokage, Boruto eventually comes
                                to respect his father and duties. Regardless, he vows to instead become a shinobi like
                                his mentor.

                                Boruto is the first child of Naruto and Hinata Uzumaki, receiving a younger sister,
                                Himawari, two years later. As his parents continued to stay close to their childhood
                                friends over the years, Boruto ultimately came to know the various parents' respective
                                kids well.

                                Akane Tsunemori from Psycho Pass is one of the industry’s greatest female characters.
                                And anime characters in general. She puts a lot of protagonist to shame for how well
                                she’s written, and there’s no fan service or cliches to make it possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just pure skill and focus. Akane isn’t an aggressive type, but she is persistent in her
                                ideals and ideas. And isn’t afraid to share them, even in the face of “authority”.

                                Shota Aizawa (相あい澤ざわ消しょう太た Aizawa Shōta?), also known as the Erasure Hero: Eraser Head
                                (イレイザー・ヘッド Ireizā Heddo?), is a Pro Hero and the homeroom teacher of U.A. High School's
                                Class 1-A.Shota is a slender and tall, pale-skinned man with messy, shoulder-length
                                black hair, that partially hangs in front of his face and half-opened black eyes. He is
                                usually recognized for his worn-out appearance,[1][2] often looking fatigued. His facial
                                hair is almost always in a stubbly, unkempt
                                state (unless he needs to look good for the press), and his eyes tired and flat, unless
                                he's in combat.
                            </p>

                                Shota is a very stern and reserved man who has lofty expectations of his students. He is
                                primarily motivated by logic and does not believe in the necessity to maintain a
                                clean-cut appearance or filter his words or ideas for others. He often comes off
                                as cold, apathetic, and impatient, exerting very little energy in most situations,
                                preferring to take naps in his sleeping bag instead.Shota has proven to be very vocal
                                and unafraid when expressing his ideas. He has mentioned
                                on several occasions that some of U.A.'s choices when it comes to examinations are not
                                practical or challenging enough for real Hero hopefuls and is adamant about having
                                certain systems used by the institution changed.[10]
                                He also blatantly stated that he did not believe Izuku Midoriya could become a hero when
                                they first met.[3] He is also known for lying to his students in order to manipulate
                                them into giving their best, a technique he describes
                                as a 'logical ruse'/'rational deception'.

                                capabilities to make others feel welcome, useful, and needed; he demonstrated this
                                disposition when he identified the Phantomhive servants' strengths and assigned them
                                compatible tasks.[4] Furthermore, Agni is exceptionally humble and frequently dismisses
                                praise.[5]

                                For the longest time, while under the influence of the Weight Crab, Hitagi was a guarded
                                person, appearing cold in order to hide away her oddity from the rest of the world,
                                hiding herself beneath a shell of aggression and appearing unapproachable to the
                                rest of her schoolmates[1]. During this time, she pushed away anyone who tried to help
                                her or get close to her, most notably her former friend Suruga Kanbaru[4]. This distrust
                                in other people was born out of her inability
                                to shoulder any regret, lingering hatred or any other such burdens, due to her
                                interaction with the Weight Crab[1].
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, as noted by Deishuu Kaiki, Hitagi is a person who refuses to let gods carry her
                                burdens, instead wishing to shoulder that weight by herself, no matter how painful it
                                may be[5], which leads to her eventual taking back of the weight that the Crab
                                severed from her. Her refusal to let sleeping dogs lie and desire to face her own past
                                instead of just letting it go also manifests in her restoring her relationship with
                                Suruga[4]. In Kaiki's words, Hitagi is a person
                                who always treats her current love as her first, showing her ability to move on and not
                                be chained down by her past[5].

                                Mitsuba. He loves Yumeko Kawai, but the reason he dislikes Kenichi is because
                                he loves her too. However, he is scared of some of Hattori's ninja techniques, and can
                                easily be intimidated by him. Kemumaki comes from the Koga clan, and the Iga and Koga
                                clan are sworn enemies. He does have a soft side
                                though. In his first appearance, it is revealed that he is a ninja.

                                to win Yumeko's heart and make Kenichi and Hattori lose. However, he does have a softer
                                side in which he helps Hattori, Kenichi, Shinzo and Shishimaru, but he mostly
                                revels in making them suffer. He also can be overbearing towards his cat Kagechiyo(Kiyo
                                in English and Indian Dub).

                                Pikachu[a] is a fictional species in the Pokémon media franchise. Designed by Atsuko
                                Nishida and Ken Sugimori, Pikachu first appeared in the 1996 Japanese video games
                                Pokémon Red and Green created by Game Freak and Nintendo, which were released outside
                                of Japan in 1998 as Pokémon Red and Blue. Pikachu is a yellow, mouse-like creature with
                                electrical abilities. It is a major character in the Pokémon franchise, serving as its
                                mascot and as a major mascot for Nintendo.

                                Pikachu is widely considered to be the most popular and well-known Pokémon species,
                                largely due to its appearance in the Pokémon anime television series as the companion of
                                protagonist Ash Ketchum. In most vocalized appearances Pikachu is voiced by Ikue
                                Ōtani, though it has been portrayed by other actors, notably Ryan Reynolds in the
                                live-action animated film Pokémon Detective Pikachu. Pikachu has been well received by
                                critics, with particular praise given for its cuteness,
                                and has come to be regarded as an icon of Japanese pop culture.

                                Rimuru is an eccentric and childish person by nature but this shouldn't be mistaken for
                                immaturity and naivety. Underneath the surface Rimuru is constantly analyzing, planning,
                                and weighing the pros and cons of his actions, taking the smart move in the
                                long-term over more rash and emotional decisions. In stark contrast to this normally
                                composed and calculative demeanor, he's absolutely ruthless when it comes to handling
                                people who have angered him. He'll go as far as
                                brutal torture and murder without batting an eye if he can get away with it and uses
                                more subtle methods like intimidation and blackmail when he can't. Rimuru also takes a
                                great deal of care with his personal image, lying
                                on official accounts, erasing memories, and creating forged historical documents to make
                                him come off as a more kind and benevolent person than he actually is in reality.
                                Despite his often selfish and nefarious tendencies,
                                Rimuru does deeply care for his subordinates, viewing them as something like a family or
                                collection of children. And thanks to the memories of Satoru Mikami and Shizue Izawa
                                Rimuru has access to a robust set of human ethics
                                to rely on when his more cruel monster self isn't up to the task. His goal in life is to
                                create a convenient world where he can kick back and lazily enjoy entertainment similar
                                in quality to what is found on Earth.

                                Anos Voldigoad (アノス・ヴォルディゴード Anosu Vorudigōdo?) is a powerful demon who was infamously
                                known during the Mythical Age as the Demon King of Tyranny (暴虐の魔王 Bōgyaku no Maō?), for
                                his immense power and cruelty towards his enemies. After giving up his life
                                to separate the world into four, he reincarnated into the Magical Age and began
                                attending the Demon King Academy, only to be branded as a misfit. He is the titular
                                protagonist of the The Misfit of Demon King Academy.

                                Anos is the reincarnation of the man who was feared as the Demon King of Tyranny two
                                thousand years ago. He is resolute, stalwart, and invincible. His absolute power instils
                                a veritable self-confidence that is only surpassed by his ego. Because of his
                                overwhelming prowess, Anos possesses an easygoing attitude and an unrivaled sense of
                                perseverance when facing any challenge that may come his way. Despite being called the
                                Demon King of Tyranny, Anos has a definitive moral
                                compass and generally has a kind and caring outlook. He takes a great interest in the
                                well-being of not only his family, but also his friends and followers, and is quick to
                                reward them for their loyalty. He is willing to
                                go through great lengths to assist in their development, in order for them to reach
                                their full potential. Other people may see him as cruel, but his personal creed is not
                                to kill people needlessly. Even if he would never
                                admit it, Anos is very protective of his fellow friends and followers. While Anos is not
                                inherently evil, his chaotic and sometimes ruthless methods when dealing with his
                                enemies, earned him his title. While he originally
                                never proclaimed himself as the Demon King, he has openly embraced it as the rest of the
                                world views him as such. Those who oppose him, fear his power, and are threatened by the
                                mere fact that a single man possesses such
                                power. The legends of his gaze striking fear into those who appear before him are not
                                just a rumor either. Just using his Magic Eyes to control others' actions is enough for
                                some to go mentally insane.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                Shōyō Hinata is the main protagonist of the Haikyū!! series by Haruichi Furudate. Shoyo
                                is a high school student who wishes to become like the "Small Giant," a former Karasuno
                                High School student and volleyball club member. To achieve his dream, he decides
                                to join Karasuno, but to join the volleyball team he and Tobio Kageyama, his old
                                opponent in a volleyball match, must overcome their rivalry and work together. For the
                                majority of the series, Hinata was a first-year student
                                at Karasuno High and one of the volleyball team's middle blockers. Hinata has a cheerful
                                and energetic personality. Hinata has an unusually high ability to jump. Since he was
                                young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate
                                for his lack of height.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He is easily excited and can be quite loud. For the most part, Hinata is very
                                simple-minded which sometimes causes him to make rash decisions. However, he is also
                                shown to be quite observant. He is capable of reading social cues and can be incredibly
                                empathetic toward others' struggles. As such, he often says just what others need to
                                hear to push themselves in the right direction. His friendly and straightforward
                                personality allows him to befriend even the quietest
                                of people effortlessly, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High.
                                Despite his easy-going personality, Hinata is extremely competitive, especially when it
                                comes to volleyball. Hinata has a very big fortitude
                                to win and thus, doesn't give up easily during a match no matter if it's a practice
                                match or a real match. Hinata can also exhibit a very scary and intimidating face when
                                people underestimate him.

                                In Demon Slayer, Doma or Douma is the Upper-Rank Two Demon, holding a prominent position
                                among Twelve Kizuki. In the manga, Doma is described as a tall and muscular man with a
                                pale complexion, and he made his debut in Chapter 96. Honestly, Doma is one
                                of the most complicated demons in the manga.

                                On one side, Doma has a friendly side and charismatic personality, and on the other
                                hand, he has an extremely dark side. For instance, Doma always prefers to eat young
                                women. In fact, Doma met Daki and Gyutaro while consuming a woman. Doma then turned
                                the siblings into demons, as was revealed in the episode. However, at the time when Doma
                                met Daki and Gyutaro, he was Upper-Rank Six. Over time, Doma grew in strength by
                                consuming humans and became Upper-Rank Two.

                                Veldora Tempest (ヴェルドラ゠テンペスト Verudora Tenpesuto?), also known as Storm Dragon Veldora
                                (暴風竜ヴェルドラ Bōfūryū Verudora?) is one of five True Dragons.</p>
                            <p>
                                Veldora is generally boisterous, excitable, but also fairly easy going. Despite his
                                reputation as someone who just wants to rampage, Veldora is largely only dangerous if he
                                doesn't get to unwind once in a while or if his loved ones are threatened. He
                                is also quite energetic, prideful, and has no reservation in showing off his strength.
                                After meeting Rimuru and reading the manga stored in Rimuru's memories, which he refers
                                to as "sacred texts", he began to reconsider
                                some of his more destructive previous behavior. His time spent in Rimuru's stomach with
                                Ifrit and his time spent living in Tempest resulted in Veldora developing a somewhat
                                more patient, analytical, and less impulsive personality.
                                Despite his nonchalant personality, he greatly appreciates Rimuru as his sworn friend
                                and trusts him. Veldora is not good at facing his older sister Velzard, so he avoids
                                contact with her as much as possible. In his mind,
                                Veldora was the baby of his family. He believed that his sisters were only there to
                                torture him. As such, he views Rimuru as his friend and brother figure in that he not
                                only understands Rimuru but also tries to serve as
                                a sort of mentor.

                                as well as being the wielder of the legendary holy sword, the Spirit God Human Sword
                                Evansmana.</p>
                            <p>
                                Kanon was a kind and courageous person, as he was noted to have the qualities of a true
                                hero, that many looked up to such as his willingness to fight and die for those who
                                could not fight for themselves, as Kanon was stated to have great charisma that
                                rallied people to him and allowed him to give hope to them. Kanon was sensitive to the
                                hearts of others and very perceptive about the feelings of others, as he could see what
                                people were trying to hide behind their outwards
                                appearances. It is noted that he had great willpower, as he was able to continue
                                battling against Anos and continuously having his sources destroyed, despite the
                                agonizing pain it would cause him. Kanon strived for peace
                                and was compassionate to even his enemies, often letting demons go if he didn't have a
                                reason to kill them. Even after all the hardships that he went through because of Anos
                                during the Great War, Kanon was able to trust
                                in him and his proposal for a peaceful world. After being killed by Jerga's allies,
                                Kanon decided to work alongside demons instead, who were more willing to forgive and
                                forget. As revealed by Lay's deeper and hidden feelings,
                                Kanon was in truth suffocated by the duties of being a hero. As a country boy, all he
                                ever wanted to do was to swing the sword. He was never strong nor righteous, he was
                                afraid of death and never even wanted to kill. But
                                more people had died by his hands than the people he managed to save. But even so,
                                someone had to bring back hope to the people, even at the expense of themselves. As he
                                kept dying and reviving, over and over again, he
                                one day realized that the people had the Hero Kanon, so who did he have? Then one day
                                someone reached out their hands to him, the very person he was supposed to kill, the
                                Demon King of Tyranny Anos Voldigoad, his "only
                                hero".

                                Velgrynd (ヴェルグリンド Verugurindo?), also known as Scorch Dragon (灼熱竜 Shakunetsuryū?), is
                                the third-oldest of the five True Dragons. She is the partner of Rudra and will not stop

                                Fitting to her title and attribute, Velgrynd is a hotheaded individual. She doesn't like
                                complex schemes and would act out of emotions at times. The most defining trait of
                                Velgrynd is her undying devotion towards Rudra. She will do anything and everything
                                as long as Rudra desires it, and will fly into rage instantly if anyone dares to insult
                                Rudra in any ways. She is largely disinterested in other matters, and only valued things
                                that Rudra would value.

                                between 1964 and 1988. It was later adapted into a television drama that aired on
                                TV Asahi from 1966 – 1968; an anime series by Shin-Ei Animation, airing on Asahi from

                                film. A remake of the 1981 anime series produced

                                always causes trouble for Kenichi and Hattori, sometimes inventing new devices to fight
                                against Hattori but always ending up in mishap. Kenichi asking Hattori to take
                                revenge is a recurring storyline present throughout many episodes. Although Hattori is a
                                good friend, Kenichi sometimes fights with him due to misunderstandings created by
                                Kemumaki. Sometimes Jippou, Togejirou and Tsubame

                                beard, and wears sunglasses, beach clothes, or martial arts suits. He usually wields a
                                walking stick and, in early appearances, wears a turtle's shell on his back. In spite of
                                his lechery, cantankerousness and occasional
                                whimsy or foolishness, he is often depicted as wise and perceptive. While a popular
                                character with Dragon Ball fans, the depiction of some of his antics has been met with
                                criticism or deemed highly controversial.

                                Tony Tony Chopper, also known as "Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper is the doctor of the Straw
                                Hat Pirates and one of the Nine Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the
                                sixth member of the crew and the fifth to join, doing so at the end of the
                                Drum Island Arc. He was temporarily forced to join the Foxy Pirates during the Long Ring
                                Long Land Arc, but was quickly returned to Luffy's crew.

                                Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows its user
                                to transform into a human hybrid or a human at will. He came from Drum Island and was
                                taught how to be a doctor by his two parental figures, Doctors Hiriluk and Kureha.
                                His dream is to one day become a doctor capable of curing any disease and wants to
                                travel all across the world specifically in the hopes of accomplishing this dream. He
                                gained his first bounty of 50 berry due to being mistaken
                                for the crew's pet after the incident at Enies Lobby. After the Dressrosa Arc, it
                                increased to 100 berry and is currently worth 1,000 berry following the Raid on
                                Onigashima.

                                Denji has a simple dream—to live a happy and peaceful life, spending time with a girl he
                                likes. This is a far cry from reality, however, as Denji is forced by the yakuza into
                                killing devils in order to pay off his crushing debts. Using his pet devil Pochita
                                as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for a bit of cash.

                                with the yakuza. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Pochita merges with Denji's
                                dead body and grants him the powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform
                                parts of his body into chainsaws, a revived Denji uses his new abilities to quickly and
                                brutally dispatch his enemies. Catching the eye of the official devil hunters who arrive
                                at the scene, he is offered work at the Public
                                Safety Bureau as one of them. Now with the means to face even the toughest of enemies,
                                Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his simple teenage dreams.

                                is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Nine Senior Officers of the
                                Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is the seventh member of the crew and the sixth
                                to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during
                                the Water 7 Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc. Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi
                                at a young age, giving her the power to reproduce
                                her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole survivor of the
                                destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is currently one of only two people in the world

                                Crocodile, who operated under the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of

                                Arabasta Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph
                                which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century. She gained a
                                bounty of 79,000,000 berry at the age of 8 due
                                to her ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara, it later increased to
                                80,000,000 berry after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby to rescue her and escape, and
                                to 130,000,000 berry after the Dressrosa Arc.
                                Currently, following the events from Raid on Onigashima, her bounty is raised to

                                Android 18, originally named Lazuli when she was an ordinary human, is the older twin
                                sister of Android 17 and Dr. Gero's eighteenth android creation, designed to serve
                                Gero's vendetta against Goku. While her interests do not initially deviate from this
                                expectation, her curiosity to activate Android 16, in spite of Gero's orders not to do
                                so, leads Android 17 to take it upon himself to murder Gero. Eventually, Android 18
                                becomes a member of the Z Fighters, as well as the

                                between light/golden or platinum that parts over her left temple, which she generally
                                keeps tucked behind her ear. She consistently wears small gold hoop earrings on both
                                ears. Her hair is apparently natural due to her not minding too much when Future Trunks
                                sliced parts of it off during his fight with her
                                She has a fairly small chest in the manga, while in the anime, her chest was implied to
                                be large enough that Master Roshi after their plane crashed took the opportunity to
                                plant his face in her bosom and motion his face
                                around, leading to her nearly killing him.

                            <p class="card-text">] Yuuichi Katagiri (片切友一, Katagiri Yūichi) is a sophomore in high
                                school. He is a poor student who lives alone and works part-time to make a living. He
                                values his friends more than anything else, following his mother's advice
                                that "friends are more important than money". An incident leads him to get involved in
                                an unreasonable game of paying off debts.

                                Yuuichi Katagiri's past is somewhat a mystery currently, although it is known that
                                Yuuichi has murdered three people and he has no idea who his real parents are. He was
                                raised by his adopted mother Katagiri Yuka who had to sell herself to make money,
                                which is a traumatic memory for Yuuichi. He also had a father figure in the form of a
                                swindler named Shiba Taizen, who taught him various psychoanalytic techniques and

                                Yuji Itadori (虎いた杖どり悠ゆう仁じ Itadori Yūji?) is the main protagonist of the Jujutsu Kaisen
                                series. He is the son of Jin Itadori and grandson of Wasuke Itadori who was living a
                                normal life until he encountered Megumi and ate one of Sukuna's fingers. After
                                becoming Sukuna's vessel, Yuji began attending Tokyo Jujutsu High alongside Megumi and
                                Nobara as first-year students
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yuji is one of his school's most powerful and talented students, Satoru Gojo placing him
                                on the same level of potential as Yuta Okkotsu and Kinji Hakari as one of the three
                                students who he believes will surpass his strength. Despite having no connections
                                to the jujutsu world before a few months prior to the Shibuya Incident, Yuji is able to
                                contend with and defeat Grade 1 and Special Grade curses. Yuji was gifted with
                                superhuman physical abilities which he masterfully combines
                                with his cursed energy. Yuji is also able to contain Sukuna with no ill effects. This
                                enables him to harm Mahito, whose control over the shape of his soul otherwise renders
                                him resistant to injury.

                                Kazuya's greatest virtue is his boundless optimism. Though he is ironically pessimistic

                                story of Kazuya's optimism and how much he admires him for it.

                                Yatora Yaguchi (矢や口ぐち八や虎とら Yaguchi Yatora?) is the protagonist of the manga series Blue
                                Period. He is a second-year high school student with remarkably high grades despite his
                                delinquent lifestyle. Yatora feels like his life is dull and predictable, that
                                is, until he comes across his senpai, Maru Mori, painting in the school's art club. He
                                discovers his passion for painting and dedicates his remaining school years to it,
                                aiming to pass the Tokyo University of the Arts entrance
                                exam.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although Yatora is very hardworking and looks composed, there is an underlying insecure
                                part of him that is further exposed when he starts making art. He has an extroverted
                                nature and can easily understand what others are looking for in a relationship,
                                further adapting himself in order to please everyone around him. For that reason, he
                                tends to oppress his own feelings and wishes. Yatora relies a lot on his studied social
                                skills whenever he is under a stressful or unfamiliar
                                situation, but when he is caught by surprise or can't keep up his composed act he has an
                                emotional outburst, often resulting in him crying and speaking more honestly. Yatora is
                                especially hard on himself, putting high standards
                                on himself while constantly undervaluing his own work and comparing himself to others,
                                which ends up overwhelming him. Whilst comparing himself with others, he has great
                                respect and admires the art that others around him
                                create. His selfless and worried nature is better shown when he goes on a trip with
                                Ayukawa, despite it being in the middle of exam season and him breaking out in rashes
                                due to extreme stress.

                                    Tenten is one of the main supporting characters in the Naruto anime/manga series and the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime/manga series. She is a chūnin-level kunoichi of Konohagakure and member of Team Guy.
She is voiced by Yukari Tamura in the Japanese version of the anime, and by Danielle Judovits in the English version of the anime.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tenten has black hair and steel-grey eyes in the manga — both of which are depicted as being dark brown in the anime. She wears her hair in Chinese-style buns on either side of her head with short fringe-bangs falling over her forehead protector which she wears in the traditional manner.Tenten strongly believes that female shinobi can be as strong as male shinobi. During the Chūnin Exams, Neji suggests that kunoichi aren't good at taijutsu, but Tenten reprimands him, explaining that girls are just as good as boys when it comes to taijutsu. Tenten's personal dream is to become as powerful, legendary and well noted female ninja as Tsunade. She can be quite fierce sometimes, especially with Lee, violently shaking him whenever he is left unconscious, Naruto also describes her personality as fierce and scary. She also says different stuff from what she thinks, like when she called Lee and idiot and reckless but in reality she knew he would have won against the Sound Nin if there weren't any distractions. Tenten also has shown a strong distaste for weakness or being overly dependent on other people. Despite this, she is not above showing a softer side when it comes to her team-mates. She holds great respect for her former team-mate, Neji, and often helped him train like the time before Neji's Chūnin Exams, she got him ready for his match.

                                  He is often calm and composed and is not easily agitated. He is often viewed as a proud character who believes that
                                  money can solve every problem. Thus he always uses his financial power to solve his problems be it in the form of bribery
                                  or compensation. He does not value the morals of human life as he often endangers several people while solving the cases.

                              Spike Spiegel is the main protagonist of the anime series Cowboy Bebop.
				    He is a bounty hunter or "cowboy" (as he's referred to on several occasions) on a spaceship called the Bebop and travels through the space with his crew consisting of his old friend, Jet, and recent members, Faye, Ed, and Ein.
                            </p>
                            <p>
				    Spike is a former member of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, who left by faking his death after falling in love with a woman named Julia. During his adventures on board the Bebop, he is drawn back into a bitter feud with Vicious, a rival from the Syndicate who seeks to kill him.
                              The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, "Waltz For Venus". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. 
				    He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots.A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an "accident").

She also demonstrates some frog-like mannerisms, such as hopping on all fours instead of running and holding herself in a way that is somewhat connotative of a frog.

                              He is referred to as the greatest magician in history and magic's greatest embarrassment, who had quit magic in order to analyze science and technology.[2] He is the de facto leader of the Science Side as the ruler of Academy City, and his actions and plans continually subvert the magic side and often move the actions of the protagonists. For those reasons, he can be arguably considered the main antagonist of the entire franchise.
