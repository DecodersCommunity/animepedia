                                series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive, strong-willed, and occasionally
                                simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha (or Leaf Village).</p>
                            <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's
                                chakra, which is much greater than the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated
                                each other, and would rarely grant Naruto his power
                                unless they were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers
                                to the fox by his name, Kurama. At this point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.

                                and its 2021 anime adaptation. 
                                He is a young man who can travel back in time: a time leaper. 
                                In order to save his girlfriend Hinata Tachibana and over time, 
                                everyone he comes to care about, he decides to become a top member of the Tokyo Manji Gang in order to do so.

                                Takemichi Hanagaki is an individual who’s lost the sense of direction, and that’s why he’s got low self-esteem. 
                                He apologizes for the smallest things and cries easily. He’s called a “crybaby hero” by his best friend Akkun.<br>
                                As he’s not very financially stable, he badmouths the rich people. 
                                He’s the best version of a weak crybaby who’s empathetic and kind beyond his years and never gives up.

                                Kai is a pale young man of narrow build with short, shaggy auburn hair, parted to the right. His eyes are thin, their irises small and gold, with rather long lower eyelashes and small eyebrows. He also possesses a small scar on the left side of his forehead that he acquired as a result of his fight with the League of Villains. He has three piercings in his left ear. He usually has his mouth covered by a plague doctor mask. Following his battle with Izuku, however, his mask is removed and his mouth is consequently uncovered. Following his defeat, he also lost both of his arms to Mr. Compress and Tomura Shigaraki during his escort to a villain hospital.

                                Kai wears a black dress shirt with matching dress pants, a pale gray tie around his neck and a belt with a long, thin buckle around his waist, with three beaded lobe piercings in his left ear. Over this, he wears a dark olive-green bomber jacket with a thick purple fur collar and white lace-up sneakers with tan soles and no socks. The white surgical gloves he wears on his hands and the magenta plague mask he wears over his mouth, which is tipped and embroidered with gold, are his most distinguishing features.

                                Minoru is a very short teenage boy with a large, round head, and rather puffy cheeks. His nose is small, stubby and points slightly upwards, and he has an unusually distinguishable philtrum, oval-shaped eyes with large, black pupils, and notably thin eyebrows. He has a head of very short dark purple hair with four large ball-shaped clumps resembling a mohawk.

                                Minoru can be very hypocritical, criticizing others for perceived perverted behavior, even if they turn out to be nothing more than misunderstandings. Minoru is one who always speaks his mind, even when it comes off as harsh and insulting due to his comments being more on the cynical side. He also has a more teasing and goading side, even when he's not being perverted, and has a habit of jeering at others for the fun of it. He is not a bully however, and does express fear and concern for when others have been hurt or are in danger.

                                His appearances are limited, due to the fact that his voice actor, Kaneto Shiozawa,

                            <p class="card-text">
                                In the early ’70s, anime was still gaining a foothold as a legitimate and profitable
                                form of entertainment. It was still largely seen as a vehicle for either dramatic
                                stories, or children's tales, but Lupin brought adult comedy anime into the forefront.
                                Although his adult-oriented themes took a while to catch on, eventually his lecherous
                                antics and suave handling of epic heists brought grown-ups firmly into anime and proved
                                to Japanese studio execs that this kind of title
                                could make them money. From Rome, to Paris, to Rio, Lupin traveled far and wide in
                                search of booty… both kinds. It was Lupin's love of women and his dirty mind that
                                provided much of the comedy in the series, and it was
                                the first time racy humor found itself in popular anime.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the most beautiful part of the anime version of Lupin is that he's much more
                                chivalrous than his manga counterpart. The anime version of the character was much more
                                appropriate for the times and fir his role as a leading man of anime.

                                Mafuyu Sato (佐藤 真冬 Satō Mafuyu) is one of the main protagonists
                                alongside Ritsuka Uenoyama in the Given anime. He attends the same school
                                as Uenoyama and has an extravagant singing voice. Ever since he asked Uenoyama
                                to fix his guitar upon their first meeting, he has become emotionally attached to
                                Uenoyama.
                                "It was a chance for me to fix the guitar, so I became attached to the summer."
                                Mafuyu owns a nine-month-old Pomeranian named Kedama. He is dating Ritsuka Uenoyama

                                Mafuyu is quiet, introverted and reserved. He has a difficult time expressing himself
                                and interacting with other people. On the other hand, Mafuyu can express his feelings
                                and emotions through his songs. He is very diligent when it comes to his band and is
                                paying attention even if it does not come across as such.
                                Mafuyu shows that he is very straightforward in his style of speech
                                and tends to take certain things literally. Despite his naive and spaced out demeanour,
                                he shows to be very sharp and observant about things that happen around him and also
                                sensitive to other people‘s emotions. Sometimes Mafuyu can be sarcastic and quite
                                aggressive.

                                be able to function at all, either as an odd-jobs business or as a meta
                                purveyor of comedy. Shinpachi is the one who makes sure they stick to a
                                schedule and complete tasks, and he even manages to keep Gintoki and
                                Kagura from committing too many arrestable offenses. As the most serious
                                and logical person in the trio, he makes the other two seem far more absurd,
                                which adds an extra layer of humor to the show.

                                But Shinpachi isn't without his own bizarre foibles
                                . If you get him talking about his idol obsession,
                                he seems every bit as ridiculous as Kagura when she's
                                eating her weight in pickled seaweed or fighting her
                                giant dog. Still, when it comes to helping the other
                                members of the Yorozuya defeat an enemy or solve a
                                serious problem, he can always be counted on.

                                Soma Schicksal is a character introduced in God Eater Burst. He is a God Eater veteran
                                at the age of only 18 and a member of the 1st Unit.
                                Son of Johannes von Schicksal and Aisha Gauche. In God Eater 2, he joined the traveling
                                branch Cradle along with Alisa, Lindow, and the Protagonist. Soma is the main character
                                in God Eater Prologue.

                                Soma is introduced during an early mission in God Eater Resurrection. He is aloof and
                                lonely, and many God Eaters try to avoid him due to the high number of casualties that
                                seem to take place near him.
                                True to the rumors, during the Protagonist's first mission with him, Eric der Vogelweid
                                is brutally killed by an Ogretail.

                                She is somewhat clueless and doesn't see herself as a special individual that needs to

                                Shōko is also hard to anger and slow to cry, as she has endured a long, painful life;
                                with her mother aside leaving her grandmother to take care of the Nishimiya sisters.
                                her hearing loss is drastic enough to the point that she can be considered clinically
                                deaf.

                                Yuno Gasai is obsessively in love with Yukiteru (Yandere) as one can
                                safely guess from just the simple name of her future diary. Yukiteru's
                                condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her "Yukiteru" diary,
                                it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries.

                                simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly
                                obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him.
                                She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise
                                that either endangers Yukki's life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts
                                turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able
                                to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts
                                thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without
                                ever losing her nerves.

					Leorio is initially introduced as a very selfish narcissist who places great emphasis on material 
					wealth. Despite his assertions that he is only after money, he eventually reveals to Kurapika that
					his dream is to one day become a doctor in order to help the poor. He believes that all things in 
					the world (lives, dreams, etc.) can be bought and that becoming a Hunter will provide him with the 
					necessary funds for his medical education. Due to his first spat with Kurapika, as well as the test 
					on the way to the navigator's cabin, it seems that he has a sensitivity for those who do not take 
					him seriously or treat him with disrespect. His real priorities seem to be friends first, then his 
					dream of becoming a great doctor, with everything else afterward.</p>

                                Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father
                                Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests..

                                Two centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and
                                Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars.
                                The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all
                                Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka;
                                at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and
                                future wars.
                                Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch;
                                these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's
                                Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail
                                Wars, free from harassment by either organization.

                                found in a cardboard box in episode 7b (I found a Puppy). While he is a beloved member
                                of the family, he is the subject of neglect thanks to his owner's forgetfulness and
                                short attention-span. He is a very intelligent dog, often presenting logic and intellect
                                that surpasses his human owners. As his meals from the Noharas are at best inconsistent
                                and at worst far-in-between, he has developed a venerable talent for foraging and
                                scavenging to survive days without meals. An oddly human-like dog, he is very
                                responsible and painstakingly careful. He saves the world under the superhero moniker of

                                He is very beloved to Shin-chan, but Shin-chan often teases, mocks and forgets him. His
                                doghouse also often ends up becoming a place for Shin-chan to hide himself or something
                                he doesn't want his family to find. Shiro often plays protector to Himawari, more often
                                than not sacrificing his well-being in the process. In SPECIAL 53 it is discovered that
                                Shiro and Shin-chan are born in the same year, which means that they are both 5 years

                                Konan is a supporting character in the manga and anime Naruto. She was the only kunoichi
                                in the Akatsuki and the partner of Nagato, being the only member to call him by his real
                                name. She became the leader of Amegakure after defecting from Akatsuki.

                                She is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka in the Japanese version of the anime, and by Dorothy
                                Elias-Fahn in the English version of the anime.</p>
                            <p>Konan was a stoic, calm, and level-headed woman (much like her partner, Nagato).

                                During her childhood, she was a bright, compassionate and relatively cheerful little
                                girl, in comparison to Yahiko's tough attitude and Nagato's sensitivity. However, the
                                traumatic events since then have led her to become very serious, and she never spoke
                                during Akatsuki meetings. Nevertheless, she has always placed the safety of her
                                team-mates above her own.

                                Blast (ブラスト, Burasuto) is the S-Class Rank 1 professional hero of the Hero Association. Outside of Saitama, he is the Hero Association's most powerful hero. He currently appears to be going to various places in order to collect the Mysterious Cubes, which is a hobby of his. Only a few select Hero Association staff members have the means to communicate with him. Blast does not disclose his personal information in the Hero Association Catalog. However, like Saitama, he considers his hero work a hobby. He also seems to have independent tendencies, keeping his location and status unknown and advising Tatsumaki to use her powers to defend herself rather than expecting others to save her. Blast holds the title of Class-Rank 1 hero of the Hero Association, earning him the distinction of being the strongest, most powerful hero in the association. Blast was presented to fans as a member of a legendary group of guardians. These legends are tasked with locating the cubes of multiple Gods all throughout world. The goal is to keep people from getting near these cubes, because if they are, they will become Mysterious Beings. Beyond this, Blast has also had some legendary battles in his day. During one such legendary battle he came up against Centichoro, a giant and one of the strongest centipedes in existence.

                            <p class="card-text">Holo is a wolf harvest deity originally from a land in the north known
                                as Yoitsu.
                                She made a promise with men from a town called Pasloe where she would ensure the town
                                would have good wheat harvests year after year.
                                However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not
                                rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes
                                from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world
                                has changed since she has been in Pasloe.
                                Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her
                                large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears.
                                Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared. </p>
                            <p>She refers to herself as the "Wise Wolf of Yoitsu" (ヨイツの賢狼).
                                She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for
                                hundreds of years in Pasloe,
                                she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She
                                relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness,
                                which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own
                                way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have,
                                as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is quite scared of that
                                fact, but hides it with jokes. She has a peculiar way of speaking, modeled after that of
                                the oiran high-class courtesans.
                                She is fond of delicious food and alcohol,
                                but especially loves apples. She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it,
                                constantly combing and maintaining it.

                                is one of Nobita's classmates and a perceived rival for Shizuka's affection.
                                His intelligence always gets him perfect scores on his tests, and he easily aces any
                                sports he played.
                                Although, his favorites are astronomy and philosophy, Dekisugi excels at any subject.
                                Thus, it's not rare for him to receive calls from his friends, asking for guidance or
                                tips.

                                Dekisugi is highly esteemed by the people around him.
                                His good behavior and academic plus athletic excellence, earns him the title of "honor
                                student" from the teachers.
                                A wide range of skills plus his good looks have charmed a lot of girls in his class, and
                                one of them is Shizuka.
                                This seemingly "perfect" image of a prince makes him to be the subject of envy of his
                                classmates, especially Nobita.

                                is one of the main character of the Doraemon franchise.
                                Gian sometimes serves as the primary antagonist in some Manga chapters
                                and anime episodes when he is bad or evil in the franchise.

                                He "rules" the neighborhood with force, often at the physical expense of other children,
                                especially Nobita, who often resorts to asking Doraemon for gadgets to get even on him.
                                He appears to be just as dependent on Nobita as Nobita is on Doraemon as he constantly
                                tells him what to do despite Nobita's protests. In addition, he has a tendency to steal

                                likes

                                She is a rich housewife who thinks she is very beautiful and wears expensive dresses and
                                jewelry.
                                She buys video games, toy robots, etc. for Suneo and cooks him cakes, delicious dishes,
                                etc.
                                She also likes to buy fancy dresses and jewelry for herself (though we never actually

                                wearing them in the 2005 anime). She is a show-off and boastful just like most of the

                                in the Honekawa Family, with the exception of Sunetsugu Honekawa and Suneo's father.

                                Hisoka Morow (ヒソカ゠モロウ, Hisoka Morou) is a Hunter and former member #4 of the Phantom
                                Troupe; his physical strength ranked third in the group. He is always in search for
                                strong opponents, and would spare those who have great potential, such as Gon and
                                Killua in order for them to get strong enough to actually challenge him.

                                Because of this, they live together in Misato's apartment. She dislikes the home at
                                first, because she is not accustomed to living in Japan.

                                Satoru Gojo is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a
                                special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world.
                                Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless
                                and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High
                                and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.
                            </p>

                                Satoru is a tall man with a lean build in his later twenties who is considered
                                relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the
                                Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black
                                blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. When sporting a
                                more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of
                                his neck. While working, Satoru wears a dark
                                blue zip-up jacket with a high collar that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit
                                matching black pants and black dress boots.

                                Saber is a heroic warrior who is summoned by a teenager named Shirou Emiya to
                                participate in a war between masters and servants who are fighting to accomplish their
                                dreams using the mythical Holy Grail.Saber's relationship with the story's other
                                characters depends on the player's decisions; she becomes a love interest to Shirou in
                                the novel's first route and also serves as that route's servant protagonist, a
                                supporting character in the second, and a villain called "Saber Alter" (セイバー・オルタ, Seibā
                                Oruta) in the third route.

                                Saber is an agile and mighty warrior who is loyal, independent, and reserved; she
                                appears emotionally cold but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals.
                                She is also present in the prequel light novel Fate/Zero, in which she is the servant of
                                Shirou's guardian Kiritsugu Emiya during the previous Holy Grail War, and in the sequel
                                Fate/hollow ataraxia. Saber also appears in the novel's printed and animated
                                adaptations, reprising her role in the game.

                                Akuto has an incredible amount of power within him that sometimes gets out of control.
                                Akuto has a highly serious personality but not without some humor. In the manga, he has
                                much more of a temper, and, in a fight, is unwilling to hold anything back.
                                In the anime, he tries to restrain himself in order to convince everyone that he has no
                                desire to be the Demon King. Powers: Akuto is capable of controlling and manipulating
                                "mana", a magical energy that resides in the
                                bodies of living things and in surroundings. For instance, he is able to absorb the mana
                                of a large demon dog, thus transforming it back into a normal puppy, a feat that has
                                never been performed before. However, his immense
                                power is also highly volatile and most of his early attempts at controlling mana and
                                creating magical projectiles, no matter how benign they are supposed to be, resulted in
                                catastrophic explosions. His name is phonetically
                                very similar to a Japanese phrase meaning "Great/Ultimate villain".

                                bounty system has caused controversies in the past as many One Piece fans tend
                                to think that it is a representation of a character's power. This time, it is Sanji's
                                new bounty that has sparked many debates as it is lower than Zoro and Jimbei's bounties.

                                City and mainly uses Rock-type Pokémon. In the anime series, Ash comes across a man

                                Brock had to take care of his many, many siblings and could not leave. This is why he
                                became a gym leader, to stay close to his family. His father comes back and states
                                that he will take care of the family. Brock left his position as a Gym Leader to travel

                                man known throughout the Kingdom of Liones as "The Strongest Holy Knight".
                                His Sacred Treasure is the Divine Axe, Rhitta, and his inherent power is called
                                Sunshine, which made him renowned for gaining immense power during the day, and
                                gradually becoming weaker with the setting of the sun, leaving him frail and

                                and night. At night, he is skittish, submissive and unfailingly polite. Whereas
                                in the day he is arrogant, boastful, and domineering, he also takes it upon
                                himself to deliver judgment to those he feels have sinned, such as those that toy
                                with feelings. Both personalities seem to be truly him, and he remembers everything
                                he does in either, though at night he has chastised himself for losing control during
                                the day.

                                Lelouch was one of the best examples of a hero gone astray. As often happens in dramatic
                                stories, his good intentions paved a road to a dark place. His rise and downfall is
                                almost Shakespearean in nature, as his own pride and arrogance cloud his judgment
                                and he misses out on what was truly important. But at least he did it all with a sense
                                of dramatic flair! His alter ego Zero, complete with mysterious helmet and flowing cape,
                                was an iconic tool to secure a place in the
                                psyche of both his enemies and his followers. In the end, Lelouch's plans are
                                successful, though not in the way anyone ever expected.

                            Not much is known about Misty's early childhood other than her technically being one of
                            the Gym Leaders alongside the three sisters. When she was very young, an encounter with 
                            a Gyarados at the Cerulean Gym led to her being frightened of them. In No Big Woop!, it
                            was revealed that Misty used to play the tambourine as a toddler. Misty often received hand
                            -me-down toys and clothes from her older sisters, who seemed to have been favored in their 
                            family, as seen during flashbacks in Princess vs. Princess. Bullying and exclusion by her 
                            sisters led Misty to leave home and effectively leave her sisters as the Gym Leaders prio
                            r to Pokémon, I Choose You!, choosing to prove herself as a Water-type Pokémon Master.

                                that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from others,
                                leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his
                                brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War,
                                and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke
                                decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its
                                inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage".

                                being the Sharingan he gave to his teammate, Kakashi Hatake.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara, but the events of the war
                                left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an ideal
                                world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ，Tobi) and Madara Uchiha himself,
                                Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance his
                                machinations, eventually going public and starting the Fourth Shinobi World War.

                                During his tenure as a pirate, he was a known member of the legendary Rocks Pirates and
                                later in life became part of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World,
                                before his death in the Summit War of Marineford.In his prime, Whitebeard was a rival to
                                Gol D. Roger, and following Roger's death, was widely recognized as the strongest man in
                                the world, a fact complimented by having
                                the highest active bounty whilst alive, and the second highest bounty of any pirate in
                                history.

                                Might Guy that would make him a taijutsu master while still a genin.

                                believes that one cannot dislike food and shows strong dedication to his promises;
                                when this promise is broken, just barely, he assigns himself arduous training to prevent
                                it from happening again.

                                Kai Hiwatari (火渡カイ Hiwatari Kai) is one of the deuteragonists from the Original Series,
                                consisting of Beyblade, Beyblade: V-Force and Beyblade: G-Revolution. He is the former
                                leader of the Blade Sharks and current leader of the G Revolutions (English
                                dub only). He is also a former member of the Blitzkrieg Boys. His Bit-Beast and Beyblade
                                is Dranzer - one of the 4 Sacred Bit-Beasts.

                                Kai is a proud and a very confident blader who is willing to sacrifice everything to get
                                what he wants. He doesn't mind crushing people on the way up though he would much prefer
                                earning things through hard work. He doesn't like to lose and feels frustrated
                                and upset whenever he does. However, when he returns to his old self, he does so with an
                                even stronger determination to win. This is a trait he shares with his Phoenix
                                Bit-Beast, Suzaku. He is a quiet and mysterious person.

                                Near (ニア, Nia) is the younger of L's two successors, raised in Wammy's House—Watari's
                                orphanage for gifted children in Winchester, England. After L's death, Near begins his
                                investigation of the Kira case, gathering evidence over a period of four years.
                                Near takes his findings to the President of the United States and reveals himself to be
                                the true successor of L. Soon after, Near becomes the head of the Special Provision for
                                Kira and continues the hunt for Kira. After
                                making contact with "L" (Light Yagami), Near begins to suspect that he is also Kira.

                                Near is a young, slender, fair-skinned man with a petite build, gray eyes, and short,
                                shaggy platinum blonde hair which he often plays with. He is only seen wearing a white,
                                long-sleeved pajama top and white pajama pants. In the anime, Near's pants are
                                light blue. In the Death Note One-Shot Special, which takes place three years after the
                                end of the Kira case, Near is shown to have sharp bags under his eyes, slightly longer
                                hair, and to have undergone a growth spurt.
                                He sits in a posture similar to L's and is often seen being expressionless.

                                Athena Asamiya (Japanese: 麻宮 アテナ, Hepburn: Asamiya Atena) is a fictional character
                                originally from the former SNK's 1987 video game Psycho Soldier.
                                An esper, Athena is a descendant of Princess Athena from the earlier Athena game. She
                                later appears in The King of Fighters series of fighting games as a member of the
                                Psycho Soldier Team alongside her friend Sie Kensou and her teacher Chin Gentsai. While
                                there have been changes to the team, Athena has been consistently playable in the main
                                series.
                                She was also given her own video game Athena:
                                Awakening from the Ordinary Life, which was only released in Japanese regions for the
                                PlayStation in 1999.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Athena was designed with idea of having an appealing main character in Psycho Soldier
                                following the staff's negative reaction to the Athena video game.
                                The use of a character song and multiple outfits resulted in major praise by
                                publications for video games.
                                Nevertheless, the character also received negative criticism.

                                Boros (ボロス, Borosu), also called Lord Boros (ボロス様, Borosu-sama) by his subordinates, was
                                the leader of the Dark Matter Thieves, a group of alien invaders responsible for the
                                destruction of A-City. Like Saitama, Boros faced a self-imposed existential crisis,
                                having become so powerful that no battle thrilled him. His intergalactic travels in
                                search of a worthy opponent led him to Earth, where he was killed by Saitama.[4]

                                Because of his incredible power, Boros was both arrogant and prideful. Due to his love
                                of battles and his inability to find an opponent who has been able to match him in
                                power, he roamed the universe looking for worthy opponents that would be able to
                                stand against him. He was also extremely callous, indifferent to the destruction and
                                loss of life his invasion caused to A-City, and the destruction of his ship and the
                                death of most of his crew while fighting Saitama.

                                In the early ’70s, anime was still gaining a foothold as a legitimate and profitable
                                form of entertainment. It was still largely seen as a vehicle for either dramatic
                                stories, or children's tales, but Lupin brought adult comedy anime into the forefront.
                                Although his adult-oriented themes took a while to catch on, eventually his lecherous
                                antics and suave handling of epic heists brought grown-ups firmly into anime and proved
                                to Japanese studio execs that this kind of title
                                could make them money. From Rome, to Paris, to Rio, Lupin traveled far and wide in
                                search of booty… both kinds. It was Lupin's love of women and his dirty mind that
                                provided much of the comedy in the series, and it was
                                the first time racy humor found itself in popular anime.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the most beautiful part of the anime version of Lupin is that he's much more
                                chivalrous than his manga counterpart. The anime version of the character was much more
                                appropriate for the times and fir his role as a leading man of anime.

                                Temari is one of the main supporting characters in the Naruto anime and manga series and
                                the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime and manga series. She is a jōnin-level
                                kunoichi of Sunagakure and one of the three Sand Siblings. Temari is the eldest child
                                and only daughter of the Fourth Kazekage, and the older sister of Kankuro and Gaara.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not being
                                afraid to speak her mind. One of the few things shown to intimidate her is her younger
                                brother Gaara. She very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding attitude,
                                when around the boy, due to the fear of Gaara's wrath. Temari does have a caring side,
                                and is not above showing concern for others. She is often seen with Shikamaru. Temari is
                                a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's
                                strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins. For actual combat she uses her
                                giant iron fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide
                                upon in order to intimidate her foes. Sometime after
                                The Fourth Shinobi War, Temari marries Shikamaru Nara and gave birth their first and
                                only son, Shikadai. She is voiced by Romi Park in the Japanese version of the anime who
                                also voiced Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist,
                                Tōshirō Hitsugaya, from Bleach. and by Tara Platt in the English version of the anime.

                                Nezuko Kamado (竈門かまど 禰ね豆ず子こ Kamado Nezuko?) is the deuteragonist of Demon Slayer:
                                Kimetsu no Yaiba. She is a demon and the younger sister of Tanjiro Kamado and one of the
                                two remaining members of the Kamado family. Formerly a human, she was attacked and
                                transformed into a demon by Muzan Kibutsuji.

                            <p>
                                Despite not being a member of the Twelve Kizuki, Nezuko is a very powerful demon. Her
                                most prominent traits is her extraordinary growth rate possibly due to the high amount
                                of blood she received from Muzan Kibutsuji when he turned Nezuko into a demon
                                and the fact that she doesn't need to consume human blood to survive.

                                Raised by an abusive father, at an early age Dio dedicated himself to destroying the
                                Joestar family after being taken in as an orphan. From tormenting the family to
                                torturing their pets,
                                Dio's evil only grew once he found the Stone Mask, a relic which turned those who wore

                                One of anime's greatest antagonists, Dio also later became a Stand user, adding to his

                                Shikamaru Nara (奈良 シカマル, Nara Shikamaru) is a fictional character in the manga and anime
                                franchise, Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto. In the anime and manga, Shikamaru is a
                                ninja affiliated with the village Hidden in the Leaves. He is a member of
                                Team 10, a group of ninja consisting of himself, Choji Akimichi, Ino Yamanaka, and team
                                leader Asuma Sarutobi. Shikamaru is portrayed as a lazy character, unwilling to apply
                                his prodigious intelligence.

                                Shikamaru Nara is one of the smartest characters in the anime manga series Naruto.
                                Masashi Kishimoto originally created Shikamaru in order for him to be the only winner of
                                an early Naruto arc: the Chunin Exams, based on his high intelligence. However,
                                recommendations from his editors resulted in Kishimoto deciding to interrupt the
                                fighting tournament between the ninjas in order to focus on a recently introduced
                                villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless, Shikamaru ends up becoming
                                the only ninja from the original test to achieve a higher rank during Part I of the
                                series.

                                Trunks has either blue[8][9][10] or lavender hair color and his mother's blue eyes. He
                                has his father's eye shape, facial features and tanned skin. Several characters, such as

                                of the Buu Saga, Present Trunks wears a dark green gi, an orange belt, orange wristbands
                                and the same golden boots that Future Trunks wears, he also wears this in the movie,
                                Bio-Broly. In the events of Broly - Second Coming,
                                Trunks wears a light green long sleeve hoodie with a black short sleeve undershirt with
                                a red collar, indigo blue denim shorts and his golden boots from his primary outfit.

                                Trunks is born in November of Age 766 to Vegeta and Bulma, thus making him a Saiyan and
                                Human hybrid, like Gohan. He was an illegitimate child due to the fact that he was
                                conceived as a result of a brief affair between his parents. In his infancy, he
                                was well-loved and doted on by his mother, but it appeared as if his father had little
                                to no parental emotions towards the boy due to the former never wanting to have children
                                and viewing hybrids as a disgrace. However,
                                after the end of the Cell Games, the relationship between his parents improved and they
                                got married, and they began raising Trunks as a family.

                                Rudeus is a tall (175cm), well-built, and cool-looking man. He was born with brown hair,
                                but after his second encounter with Orsted, his hair temporarily became white. His eyes
                                are also slightly mismatched as he switched both of his eyes out for demon
                                eyes. Like Paul, he also has a mole underneath his left eye.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because of his former life, he is careful not to get carried away and become arrogant.
                                As a result, he is extremely self-aware and humble because he does not want to revert to
                                his old self. He is a kind person, helping his friends and protecting his family
                                whenever needed. Due to being capable in many fields, people have high expectations of
                                him. Rudeus is very polite to others, often making them uncomfortable.

                                Kakashi Hatake is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the
                                Sharingan , he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice
                                and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on
                                Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson,
                                along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth
                                Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth
                                Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).

                                Kakashi became a Jonin and was sent on a mission along with Obito and Rin, They where to
                                destroy a bridge that was being used by enemy forces to enter Konoha and therefore help
                                in the third great shinobi war effort. But disaster struck when Rin was taken
                                by two Iwagakure Jonin. Obito wanted to rescue his teammate; But Kakashi said that the
                                mission came first. Kakashi found himself in the same situation as his father had been
                                in the past and did not want to make the mistakes
                                that his father had. Obito disagreed and left Kakashi not before telling him that what
                                his father did in the past made him a hero not a disgrace.

                                Johan Liebert (ヨハン・リーベルト, Yohan Rīberuto) is the titular "monster" and main antagonist
                                of the series. He is the older twin brother of Nina Fortner (formerly known as Anna
                                Liebert) who was shot in the head in 1986, but he was operated on and saved from
                                death by Dr. Kenzo Tenma. Because of this, he is very grateful to Dr. Tenma and extends
                                a profound respect towards his savior throughout the series.

                                to cruelly manipulate and corrupt others, often with no apparent end other than
                                to cause suffering and destruction for his pleasure. His original goal, as he states
                                when he is young, was to be the last one standing at the end of the world, though later
                                he decides upon a different fate toward the height
                                of this pursuit, to erase himself from the world and commit the perfect suicide.

                                Ever the reluctant fighter, Vash was a living contradiction. He's gifted with superhuman
                                fighting abilities, but also a superhuman capacity for compassion and kindness. He's a
                                character who suffered countless scars and wounds to his own body to protect
                                others, even the very villains he was trying to stop, and his vow to never take a life
                                provides plenty of drama in Trigun as his enemies use his virtue against him.

                                Vash is called "the humanoid typhoon" because utter destruction tends to follow him
                                wherever he goes, and there's a huge bounty on his head. But in reality, he's humanity's
                                secret guardian angel on the distant, wild planet of Gunsmoke. As a "Plant," he's
                                a being with power that few can comprehend. He's the greatest gunman on the planet, and
                                all the criminals he faces don't stand a chance against him. But Vash's true challenge
                                is in saving the world from his "brother" Knives,
                                and it's this conflict that brings out Vash's real heroism. The tale of Vash's childhood
                                and his mother figure Rem is a great story, as is the story of how Knives ended up being
                                the polar opposite of Vash. Although Vash
                                is often portrayed as a childish goofball, in reality he's a very complex and tortured
                                character who is doing his best to save people who never even know what he's done for
                                them.

                                Nagato (長門, Nagato) was a shinobi of Amegakure and descendant of the Uzumaki clan.
                                Forming Akatsuki alongside his friends (and fellow war orphans) Yahiko and Konan, Nagato
                                dreamed of bringing peace to the violent shinobi world. However, following Yahiko's
                                death, Nagato adopted the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein) and, along with Konan, began leading
                                a new Akatsuki — one that would force the world into peace using any means necessary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nagato lived with his parents: Fusō and Ise on the outskirts of Amegakure. When he was
                                very young, Madara Uchiha secretly transplanted his Rinnegan into Nagato without his or
                                his parents' knowledge.[8] Sometime later, during the Second Shinobi World War,
                                Nagato and his parents took shelter in their home to avoid the fighting going on around
                                them.

                                form. Shinichi took the appearance of his six or seven-year-old self after being exposed
                                to a prototype poison called APTX 4869, which he had been forced to swallow
                                by two men in black later revealed to be members of the Black Organization. The poison
                                de-aged Shinichi's entire body except for his nervous system and therefore he still has
                                the personality, memories, and incredible deductive
                                ability of his teenage self.

                                As Conan, Shinichi helps Ran's father solve cases by putting him to sleep and simulating
                                Kogoro's voice using the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him. He also
                                spends a good amount of time with his Detective Boys fellows and solves many
                                small cases with them and sometimes in the company of Professor Agasa.

                                Sōma Yukihira (幸ゆき平ひら 創そう真ま, Yukihira Sōma?) is the main protagonist of Shokugeki no
                                Soma. He is the son of Jōichirō Yukihira and Tamako Yukihira, the proud owner of
                                Restaurant Yukihira. He is a 92nd Tōtsuki Generation alumnus and a former resident of
                                Polar Star Dormitory. He is also a previous 1st seat of the Elite Ten Council

                                Sōma's main outfit is his Restaurant Yukihira cooking uniform, consisting of a black
                                shirt with the restaurant's logo on the back and left chest area of his shirt. Whenever
                                he cooks, he wears a white apron over his waist. While at Tōtsuki, Sōma wears
                                a black coat summer school uniform over his Yukihira cooking uniform. Sōma also ties his
                                trademark white headband around his forehead whenever he cooks. If he is not cooking or
                                bathing, he wears his headband around his
                                left wrist. Compared to his fellow Tōtsuki students, Sōma dresses very casually; in his
                                free time, he sports a hanten jacket with a simple white shirt beneath it and a striped
                                track pants at his places of residence. Sōma
                                states that dressing in his hanten calms him down.

                                at R2) and the Second Prince of the Britannian Imperial Family, as well as the Prime
                                Minister of the Holy Britannian Empire. He is a strategist on par with Lelouch,
                                and the only person Lelouch was unable to beat in chess as a child.Charismatic and
                                manipulative, cunning and ruthless, Schneizel is widely regarded as Lelouch's greatest
                                adversary, including Lelouch himself, and the Prime
                                Minister serves as one of the primary antagonists of the series, particularly in Season
                                2, where he becomes the series' final antagonist.

                                Schneizel is charismatic and calculating, able to form complex strategies that can match
                                even Lelouch's. Despite this, he shows a caring side to his subordinates, earning their
                                respect and loyalty. His hierarchy in the Britannian family gives him great
                                power and influence; though he does have ambitions for the throne, a fact the Emperor
                                seems aware of but not concerned by.

                                Anthy Himemiya (also known as Himemiya Ansh) is a mysterious girl who is considered to
                                be a girl who has no ideas or desires other than what her current master expects of her.
                                She often becomes the subject of other characters' fury because she tends to
                                act like a "doormat" and take what they want or desire. Her personality alternates
                                between unselfish love, passive-aggressive revenge, and taught helplessness. Her past
                                and present selves are tragic and spiteful. Anthy,
                                like Utena Tenjou, both defies and fits the preconceptions that she represents as both a
                                princess and a witch.

                                jewel and is notably darker than the others.

                                frequently heads to the rooftop during his lunch breaks to develop his passion.

                                Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is the Demon King, the first of his kind, as well as the progenitor
                                of all other demons in existence. [8] Muzan is also the leader of the Twelve

                                under him.[9]

                                exceptions.[13] It is later revealed that Muzan is of the same bloodline as the

                                Akane Tsunemori from Psycho Pass is one of the industry’s greatest female characters.
                                And anime characters in general. She puts a lot of protagonist to shame for how well
                                she’s written, and there’s no fan service or cliches to make it possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just pure skill and focus. Akane isn’t an aggressive type, but she is persistent in her
                                ideals and ideas. And isn’t afraid to share them, even in the face of “authority”.

                                visible irises or pupils. His eyes frequently tear-up when he gets emotional.

                                Shota Aizawa (相あい澤ざわ消しょう太た Aizawa Shōta?), also known as the Erasure Hero: Eraser Head
                                (イレイザー・ヘッド Ireizā Heddo?), is a Pro Hero and the homeroom teacher of U.A. High School's
                                Class 1-A.Shota is a slender and tall, pale-skinned man with messy, shoulder-length
                                black hair, that partially hangs in front of his face and half-opened black eyes. He is
                                usually recognized for his worn-out appearance,[1][2] often looking fatigued. His facial
                                hair is almost always in a stubbly, unkempt
                                state (unless he needs to look good for the press), and his eyes tired and flat, unless
                                he's in combat.
                            </p>

                                Shota is a very stern and reserved man who has lofty expectations of his students. He is
                                primarily motivated by logic and does not believe in the necessity to maintain a
                                clean-cut appearance or filter his words or ideas for others. He often comes off
                                as cold, apathetic, and impatient, exerting very little energy in most situations,
                                preferring to take naps in his sleeping bag instead.Shota has proven to be very vocal
                                and unafraid when expressing his ideas. He has mentioned
                                on several occasions that some of U.A.'s choices when it comes to examinations are not
                                practical or challenging enough for real Hero hopefuls and is adamant about having
                                certain systems used by the institution changed.[10]
                                He also blatantly stated that he did not believe Izuku Midoriya could become a hero when
                                they first met.[3] He is also known for lying to his students in order to manipulate
                                them into giving their best, a technique he describes
                                as a 'logical ruse'/'rational deception'.

                                disposition when he identified the Phantomhive servants' strengths and assigned them
                                compatible tasks.[4] Furthermore, Agni is exceptionally humble and frequently dismisses
                                praise.[5]

                                For the longest time, while under the influence of the Weight Crab, Hitagi was a guarded
                                person, appearing cold in order to hide away her oddity from the rest of the world,
                                hiding herself beneath a shell of aggression and appearing unapproachable to the
                                rest of her schoolmates[1]. During this time, she pushed away anyone who tried to help
                                her or get close to her, most notably her former friend Suruga Kanbaru[4]. This distrust
                                in other people was born out of her inability
                                to shoulder any regret, lingering hatred or any other such burdens, due to her
                                interaction with the Weight Crab[1].
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, as noted by Deishuu Kaiki, Hitagi is a person who refuses to let gods carry her
                                burdens, instead wishing to shoulder that weight by herself, no matter how painful it
                                may be[5], which leads to her eventual taking back of the weight that the Crab
                                severed from her. Her refusal to let sleeping dogs lie and desire to face her own past
                                instead of just letting it go also manifests in her restoring her relationship with
                                Suruga[4]. In Kaiki's words, Hitagi is a person
                                who always treats her current love as her first, showing her ability to move on and not
                                be chained down by her past[5].

                                in a block of flats with his cat Kagechiyo, and happens to be the opposite of Kenichi
                                Mitsuba. He loves Yumeko Kawai, but the reason he dislikes Kenichi is because
                                he loves her too. However, he is scared of some of Hattori's ninja techniques, and can
                                easily be intimidated by him. Kemumaki comes from the Koga clan, and the Iga and Koga
                                clan are sworn enemies. He does have a soft side
                                though. In his first appearance, it is revealed that he is a ninja.

                                Kemumaki is a selfish Koga-ninja who cons a lot of people, but his biggest ambition is
                                to win Yumeko's heart and make Kenichi and Hattori lose. However, he does have a softer
                                side in which he helps Hattori, Kenichi, Shinzo and Shishimaru, but he mostly
                                revels in making them suffer. He also can be overbearing towards his cat Kagechiyo(Kiyo
                                in English and Indian Dub).

                                Ajimu has a mysterious personality, speaking cryptically and explaining very little.
                                Zenkichi Hitoyoshi does not recognize nor remember her; she claims that because her face
                                was ripped off, she is nobody. She seems to care for Medaka, as she refers to her with a
                                familiar tone, and tells Zenkichi not to make her cry anymore.
                                Ajimu seems to exist in the hearts of both Zenkichi and Kumagawa. Each time Kumagawa
                                dies, he encounters her in his heart before he can revive himself with his All
                                Fiction.[1] Because of this, he has come to regard her with extreme hatred.[2] On the
                                other hand she has a rather strong affection for Zenkichi, crying tears of joy upon
                                meeting him at Hakoniwa Academy.
                            </p>

                                Ajimu is a very pretty girl, causing Zenkichi to blush the first time he saw her,[5] and
                                even Kumagawa speculates that he fell in love with her because of her looks.[6] She has
                                dark brown eyes and very long, dark brown hair tied up with two yellow ribbons. In the
                                dream world, Ajimu appears as she did in middle school: wearing the girl's uniform of
                                Hakobune Middle School; a sailor uniform comprised of a light pink shirt with a dark red
                                trim, and a matching dark red skirt.
                                She also wears two pink wrist bands and thigh high black socks. Her name is written on
                                her shoes.

                                Lelouch vi Britannia (ルルーシュ・ヴィ・ブリタニア, Rurūshu vi Buritania) is the main protagonist of
                                Code Geass:
                                Lelouch of the Rebellion and Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2, and plays a
                                supporting role in sidestories like Code Geass: Oz the Reflection and Code Geass:
                                Lancelot & Guren. After he was exiled, he used the alias, Lelouch Lamperouge
                                (ルルーシュ・ランペルージ, Rurūshu Ranperūji). He was the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian
                                Empire and the son of the 98th Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia. He was also
                                the leader and founder of The Black Knights and the real identity of Zero. He is voiced
                                by Jun Fukuyama, while his child self is voiced by Sayaka Ohara.
                                His English dub voice is provided by Johnny Yong Bosch with Michelle Ruff doing
                                Lelouch's child voice.

                                His mother's death and his father's apparent lack of concern in regards to it were huge
                                blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and
                                made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the
                                true reason for his mother's death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace,
                                a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if
                                at all.

                                Rimuru Tempest (リムル゠テンペスト Rimuru Tenpesuto?) is the main protagonist of That Time I Got
                                Reincarnated as a Slime and the reincarnation of Satoru Mikami.

                                Rimuru is an eccentric and childish person by nature but this shouldn't be mistaken for
                                immaturity and naivety. Underneath the surface Rimuru is constantly analyzing, planning,
                                and weighing the pros and cons of his actions, taking the smart move in the
                                long-term over more rash and emotional decisions. In stark contrast to this normally
                                composed and calculative demeanor, he's absolutely ruthless when it comes to handling
                                people who have angered him. He'll go as far as
                                brutal torture and murder without batting an eye if he can get away with it and uses
                                more subtle methods like intimidation and blackmail when he can't. Rimuru also takes a
                                great deal of care with his personal image, lying
                                on official accounts, erasing memories, and creating forged historical documents to make
                                him come off as a more kind and benevolent person than he actually is in reality.
                                Despite his often selfish and nefarious tendencies,
                                Rimuru does deeply care for his subordinates, viewing them as something like a family or
                                collection of children. And thanks to the memories of Satoru Mikami and Shizue Izawa
                                Rimuru has access to a robust set of human ethics
                                to rely on when his more cruel monster self isn't up to the task. His goal in life is to
                                create a convenient world where he can kick back and lazily enjoy entertainment similar
                                in quality to what is found on Earth.

                                Anos Voldigoad (アノス・ヴォルディゴード Anosu Vorudigōdo?) is a powerful demon who was infamously
                                known during the Mythical Age as the Demon King of Tyranny (暴虐の魔王 Bōgyaku no Maō?), for
                                his immense power and cruelty towards his enemies. After giving up his life
                                to separate the world into four, he reincarnated into the Magical Age and began
                                attending the Demon King Academy, only to be branded as a misfit. He is the titular
                                protagonist of the The Misfit of Demon King Academy.

                                Anos is the reincarnation of the man who was feared as the Demon King of Tyranny two
                                thousand years ago. He is resolute, stalwart, and invincible. His absolute power instils
                                a veritable self-confidence that is only surpassed by his ego. Because of his
                                overwhelming prowess, Anos possesses an easygoing attitude and an unrivaled sense of
                                perseverance when facing any challenge that may come his way. Despite being called the
                                Demon King of Tyranny, Anos has a definitive moral
                                compass and generally has a kind and caring outlook. He takes a great interest in the
                                well-being of not only his family, but also his friends and followers, and is quick to
                                reward them for their loyalty. He is willing to
                                go through great lengths to assist in their development, in order for them to reach
                                their full potential. Other people may see him as cruel, but his personal creed is not
                                to kill people needlessly. Even if he would never
                                admit it, Anos is very protective of his fellow friends and followers. While Anos is not
                                inherently evil, his chaotic and sometimes ruthless methods when dealing with his
                                enemies, earned him his title. While he originally
                                never proclaimed himself as the Demon King, he has openly embraced it as the rest of the
                                world views him as such. Those who oppose him, fear his power, and are threatened by the
                                mere fact that a single man possesses such
                                power. The legends of his gaze striking fear into those who appear before him are not
                                just a rumor either. Just using his Magic Eyes to control others' actions is enough for
                                some to go mentally insane.

                                Shōyō Hinata is the main protagonist of the Haikyū!! series by Haruichi Furudate. Shoyo
                                is a high school student who wishes to become like the "Small Giant," a former Karasuno
                                High School student and volleyball club member. To achieve his dream, he decides
                                to join Karasuno, but to join the volleyball team he and Tobio Kageyama, his old
                                opponent in a volleyball match, must overcome their rivalry and work together. For the
                                majority of the series, Hinata was a first-year student
                                at Karasuno High and one of the volleyball team's middle blockers. Hinata has a cheerful
                                and energetic personality. Hinata has an unusually high ability to jump. Since he was
                                young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate
                                for his lack of height.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He is easily excited and can be quite loud. For the most part, Hinata is very
                                simple-minded which sometimes causes him to make rash decisions. However, he is also
                                shown to be quite observant. He is capable of reading social cues and can be incredibly
                                empathetic toward others' struggles. As such, he often says just what others need to
                                hear to push themselves in the right direction. His friendly and straightforward
                                personality allows him to befriend even the quietest
                                of people effortlessly, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High.
                                Despite his easy-going personality, Hinata is extremely competitive, especially when it
                                comes to volleyball. Hinata has a very big fortitude
                                to win and thus, doesn't give up easily during a match no matter if it's a practice
                                match or a real match. Hinata can also exhibit a very scary and intimidating face when
                                people underestimate him.

                                In Demon Slayer, Doma or Douma is the Upper-Rank Two Demon, holding a prominent position
                                among Twelve Kizuki. In the manga, Doma is described as a tall and muscular man with a
                                pale complexion, and he made his debut in Chapter 96. Honestly, Doma is one
                                of the most complicated demons in the manga.

                                On one side, Doma has a friendly side and charismatic personality, and on the other
                                hand, he has an extremely dark side. For instance, Doma always prefers to eat young
                                women. In fact, Doma met Daki and Gyutaro while consuming a woman. Doma then turned
                                the siblings into demons, as was revealed in the episode. However, at the time when Doma
                                met Daki and Gyutaro, he was Upper-Rank Six. Over time, Doma grew in strength by
                                consuming humans and became Upper-Rank Two.

                                (暴風竜ヴェルドラ Bōfūryū Verudora?) is one of five True Dragons.</p>
                            <p>
                                Veldora is generally boisterous, excitable, but also fairly easy going. Despite his
                                reputation as someone who just wants to rampage, Veldora is largely only dangerous if he
                                doesn't get to unwind once in a while or if his loved ones are threatened. He
                                is also quite energetic, prideful, and has no reservation in showing off his strength.
                                After meeting Rimuru and reading the manga stored in Rimuru's memories, which he refers
                                to as "sacred texts", he began to reconsider
                                some of his more destructive previous behavior. His time spent in Rimuru's stomach with
                                Ifrit and his time spent living in Tempest resulted in Veldora developing a somewhat
                                more patient, analytical, and less impulsive personality.
                                Despite his nonchalant personality, he greatly appreciates Rimuru as his sworn friend
                                and trusts him. Veldora is not good at facing his older sister Velzard, so he avoids
                                contact with her as much as possible. In his mind,
                                Veldora was the baby of his family. He believed that his sisters were only there to
                                torture him. As such, he views Rimuru as his friend and brother figure in that he not
                                only understands Rimuru but also tries to serve as
                                a sort of mentor.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                Kanon (カノン Kanon?), commonly known as Hero Kanon (勇者カノン Yūsha Kanon?), was the legendary
                                human hero who fought against the Demon King Anos during the Great War that occurred
                                2,000 years ago. Kanon was famous for having seven sources that made him nigh-immortal,
                                as well as being the wielder of the legendary holy sword, the Spirit God Human Sword
                                Evansmana.</p>
                            <p>
                                Kanon was a kind and courageous person, as he was noted to have the qualities of a true
                                hero, that many looked up to such as his willingness to fight and die for those who
                                could not fight for themselves, as Kanon was stated to have great charisma that
                                rallied people to him and allowed him to give hope to them. Kanon was sensitive to the
                                hearts of others and very perceptive about the feelings of others, as he could see what
                                people were trying to hide behind their outwards
                                appearances. It is noted that he had great willpower, as he was able to continue
                                battling against Anos and continuously having his sources destroyed, despite the
                                agonizing pain it would cause him. Kanon strived for peace
                                and was compassionate to even his enemies, often letting demons go if he didn't have a
                                reason to kill them. Even after all the hardships that he went through because of Anos
                                during the Great War, Kanon was able to trust
                                in him and his proposal for a peaceful world. After being killed by Jerga's allies,
                                Kanon decided to work alongside demons instead, who were more willing to forgive and
                                forget. As revealed by Lay's deeper and hidden feelings,
                                Kanon was in truth suffocated by the duties of being a hero. As a country boy, all he
                                ever wanted to do was to swing the sword. He was never strong nor righteous, he was
                                afraid of death and never even wanted to kill. But
                                more people had died by his hands than the people he managed to save. But even so,
                                someone had to bring back hope to the people, even at the expense of themselves. As he
                                kept dying and reviving, over and over again, he
                                one day realized that the people had the Hero Kanon, so who did he have? Then one day
                                someone reached out their hands to him, the very person he was supposed to kill, the
                                Demon King of Tyranny Anos Voldigoad, his "only
                                hero".

                                Velgrynd (ヴェルグリンド Verugurindo?), also known as Scorch Dragon (灼熱竜 Shakunetsuryū?), is
                                the third-oldest of the five True Dragons. She is the partner of Rudra and will not stop

                            <p>
                                Fitting to her title and attribute, Velgrynd is a hotheaded individual. She doesn't like
                                complex schemes and would act out of emotions at times. The most defining trait of
                                Velgrynd is her undying devotion towards Rudra. She will do anything and everything
                                as long as Rudra desires it, and will fly into rage instantly if anyone dares to insult
                                Rudra in any ways. She is largely disinterested in other matters, and only valued things
                                that Rudra would value.

                                Unlike most of the other Naruto characters, his fighting style is unique, as he uses

                                He became very skilled at a young age. Both of his voice actors do an excellent job at

                                series, to the elegant robes he wore during Shippuden.

                                    Kayaba Akihiko (茅場晶彦, Kayaba Akihiko?), known as Heathcliff (ヒースクリフ, Hīsukurifu?) in
                                    Sword Art Online, was the main antagonist of the Aincrad Arc and a supporting
                                    character in the Fairy Dance Arc and Alicization Arc.

                                    He was the development director and Game Master (GM) of Sword Art Online, as well as
                                    the designer of the NerveGear, the Cardinal System, and The Seed.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Kayaba Akihiko choose to fulfill his dream by making a death game which cost
                                    thousands of lives, and simply noted that their minds were gone from both worlds.
                                    His fascination with computers was very much like Kirito's, with the major
                                    difference being Akihiko having no regard for the lives of others, and Kirito doing
                                    everything he can to protect them. </p>

                                <p> In spite of this, Akihiko had a level of honor and fairness. He designed Sword Art
                                    Online to be a beatable game by anyone who had the skills. He never interfered with
                                    the players' progress to keep them from advancing through the game; in fact, as
                                    Heathcliff, he was actually fighting on the players' side, helping them clear
                                    floors. The one exception to this was the fact that he made himself invincible until
                                    his battle with Kirito, although this was necessary to survive the game until the
                                    95th floor was reached, where Heathcliff planned to reveal his true identity and
                                    become the final boss on the 100th floor.

                                The main antagonists are Kemumaki, a Koga Ninja, and his ninja-cat, Kagechiyo. Kemumaki
                                always causes trouble for Kenichi and Hattori, sometimes inventing new devices to fight
                                against Hattori but always ending up in mishap. Kenichi asking Hattori to take
                                revenge is a recurring storyline present throughout many episodes. Although Hattori is a
                                good friend, Kenichi sometimes fights with him due to misunderstandings created by
                                Kemumaki. Sometimes Jippou, Togejirou and Tsubame
                                help him.

                                Master Roshi ("Old Heavenly Martial Arts Master"), also known as the Turtle Hermit and
                                God of Martial Arts is a perverted hermit and a master of martial arts. He lives on his
                                own isolated island called Kame House, where he may be willing to train students
                                who travel to his doorstep. He is also the originator of the Kamehameha Wave. Despite
                                his lecherous tendencies and his old age, Roshi is an extremely respected and capable
                                warrior, serving as the master of Gohan, Ox-King,
                                Goku, Krillin, and Yamcha. His drive to push his students to new heights and support
                                them on their martial arts journeys makes him one of the most notable supporting
                                characters in the series.

                                Within the series, he is an elderly martial arts master, born on March 20th, who is the
                                innovator of the Kamehameha (カメハメ波) technique. His students include Grandpa Son Gohan,
                                The Ox-King, Son Goku, Krillin and Yamcha. He is bald, sports a thick van dyke
                                beard, and wears sunglasses, beach clothes, or martial arts suits. He usually wields a
                                walking stick and, in early appearances, wears a turtle's shell on his back. In spite of
                                his lechery, cantankerousness and occasional
                                whimsy or foolishness, he is often depicted as wise and perceptive. While a popular
                                character with Dragon Ball fans, the depiction of some of his antics has been met with
                                criticism or deemed highly controversial.

                                His dream is to one day become a doctor capable of curing any disease and wants to
                                travel all across the world specifically in the hopes of accomplishing this dream. He
                                gained his first bounty of 50 berry due to being mistaken
                                for the crew's pet after the incident at Enies Lobby. After the Dressrosa Arc, it
                                increased to 100 berry and is currently worth 1,000 berry following the Raid on

                                as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for a bit of cash.

                                Unfortunately, he has outlived his usefulness and is murdered by a devil in contract
                                with the yakuza. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Pochita merges with Denji's
                                dead body and grants him the powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform
                                parts of his body into chainsaws, a revived Denji uses his new abilities to quickly and
                                brutally dispatch his enemies. Catching the eye of the official devil hunters who arrive
                                at the scene, he is offered work at the Public
                                Safety Bureau as one of them. Now with the means to face even the toughest of enemies,
                                Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his simple teenage dreams.

                                Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is the seventh member of the crew and the sixth
                                to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during
                                the Water 7 Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc. Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi
                                at a young age, giving her the power to reproduce

                                Crocodile, who operated under the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of

                                Arabasta Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph
                                which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century. She gained a
                                bounty of 79,000,000 berry at the age of 8 due
                                to her ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara, it later increased to
                                80,000,000 berry after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby to rescue her and escape, and
                                to 130,000,000 berry after the Dressrosa Arc.
                                Currently, following the events from Raid on Onigashima, her bounty is raised to
                                930,000,000 berry.

                                agree to such things personally. She is a tsundere.

                                Android 18, originally named Lazuli when she was an ordinary human, is the older twin
                                sister of Android 17 and Dr. Gero's eighteenth android creation, designed to serve
                                Gero's vendetta against Goku. While her interests do not initially deviate from this
                                expectation, her curiosity to activate Android 16, in spite of Gero's orders not to do
                                so, leads Android 17 to take it upon himself to murder Gero. Eventually, Android 18
                                becomes a member of the Z Fighters, as well as the
                                wife of Krillin and the mother of their daughter Marron.

                                complexion. She has shoulder-length blonde hair, although its specific shade varied
                                between light/golden or platinum that parts over her left temple, which she generally
                                keeps tucked behind her ear. She consistently wears small gold hoop earrings on both
                                ears. Her hair is apparently natural due to her not minding too much when Future Trunks
                                sliced parts of it off during his fight with her
                                She has a fairly small chest in the manga, while in the anime, her chest was implied to
                                be large enough that Master Roshi after their plane crashed took the opportunity to
                                plant his face in her bosom and motion his face
                                around, leading to her nearly killing him.

                                series. He is the son of Jin Itadori and grandson of Wasuke Itadori who was living a
                                normal life until he encountered Megumi and ate one of Sukuna's fingers. After
                                becoming Sukuna's vessel, Yuji began attending Tokyo Jujutsu High alongside Megumi and
                                Nobara as first-year students

                                Yuji is one of his school's most powerful and talented students, Satoru Gojo placing him
                                on the same level of potential as Yuta Okkotsu and Kinji Hakari as one of the three
                                students who he believes will surpass his strength. Despite having no connections
                                to the jujutsu world before a few months prior to the Shibuya Incident, Yuji is able to
                                contend with and defeat Grade 1 and Special Grade curses. Yuji was gifted with
                                superhuman physical abilities which he masterfully combines
                                with his cursed energy. Yuji is also able to contain Sukuna with no ill effects. This
                                enables him to harm Mahito, whose control over the shape of his soul otherwise renders
                                him resistant to injury.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                Yatora Yaguchi (矢や口ぐち八や虎とら Yaguchi Yatora?) is the protagonist of the manga series Blue
                                Period. He is a second-year high school student with remarkably high grades despite his
                                delinquent lifestyle. Yatora feels like his life is dull and predictable, that
                                is, until he comes across his senpai, Maru Mori, painting in the school's art club. He
                                discovers his passion for painting and dedicates his remaining school years to it,
                                aiming to pass the Tokyo University of the Arts entrance
                                exam.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although Yatora is very hardworking and looks composed, there is an underlying insecure
                                part of him that is further exposed when he starts making art. He has an extroverted
                                nature and can easily understand what others are looking for in a relationship,
                                further adapting himself in order to please everyone around him. For that reason, he
                                tends to oppress his own feelings and wishes. Yatora relies a lot on his studied social
                                skills whenever he is under a stressful or unfamiliar
                                situation, but when he is caught by surprise or can't keep up his composed act he has an
                                emotional outburst, often resulting in him crying and speaking more honestly. Yatora is
                                especially hard on himself, putting high standards
                                on himself while constantly undervaluing his own work and comparing himself to others,
                                which ends up overwhelming him. Whilst comparing himself with others, he has great
                                respect and admires the art that others around him
                                create. His selfless and worried nature is better shown when he goes on a trip with
                                Ayukawa, despite it being in the middle of exam season and him breaking out in rashes
                                due to extreme stress.

                                She is one of the main supporting characters of Re:Zero, with major roles in Arc 2, Arc
                                3, and Arc 7. During the first half of Arc 2, she also served as the secondary
                                antagonist.

                                While initially distrustful of Subaru, she eventually opened up to him and even
                                developed strong feelings for him after he saved her. However, at the end of Arc 3, she
                                had her name and memories eaten by Lye Batenkaitos and subsequently fell into suspended
                                animation.
                                At the end of Arc 6, she finally woke up from her slumber following Lye's death, but now
                                suffers amnesia due to not having yet regained her memories. She was been transported to
                                the Sacred Empire of Vollacia with Subaru and Louis Arneb at end of Arc 6.
                                Though Vincent, Subaru, Al and others left for the Demon City of Chaosflame, she stayed
                                behind in Guaral in order to be tutored by Priscilla Barielle in how to better herself
                                in the arts of Healing Magic.

                                Tenten is one of the main supporting characters in the Naruto anime/manga series and the
                                Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime/manga series. She is a chūnin-level kunoichi of
                                Konohagakure and member of Team Guy.
                                She is voiced by Yukari Tamura in the Japanese version of the anime, and by Danielle
                                Judovits in the English version of the anime.

                                Tenten has black hair and steel-grey eyes in the manga — both of which are depicted as
                                being dark brown in the anime. She wears her hair in Chinese-style buns on either side
                                of her head with short fringe-bangs falling over her forehead protector which she wears
                                in the traditional manner.Tenten strongly believes that female shinobi can be as strong
                                as male shinobi. During the Chūnin Exams, Neji suggests that kunoichi aren't good at
                                taijutsu, but Tenten reprimands him, explaining that girls are just as good as boys when
                                it comes to taijutsu. Tenten's personal dream is to become as powerful, legendary and
                                well noted female ninja as Tsunade. She can be quite fierce sometimes, especially with
                                Lee, violently shaking him whenever he is left unconscious, Naruto also describes her
                                personality as fierce and scary. She also says different stuff from what she thinks,
                                like when she called Lee and idiot and reckless but in reality she knew he would have
                                won against the Sound Nin if there weren't any distractions. Tenten also has shown a
                                strong distaste for weakness or being overly dependent on other people. Despite this,
                                she is not above showing a softer side when it comes to her team-mates. She holds great
                                respect for her former team-mate, Neji, and often helped him train like the time before
                                Neji's Chūnin Exams, she got him ready for his match.

                                Tenten is one of the main supporting characters in the Naruto anime/manga series and the
                                Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime/manga series. She is a chūnin-level kunoichi of
                                Konohagakure and member of Team Guy.
                                She is voiced by Yukari Tamura in the Japanese version of the anime, and by Danielle
                                Judovits in the English version of the anime.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tenten has black hair and steel-grey eyes in the manga — both of which are depicted as
                                being dark brown in the anime. She wears her hair in Chinese-style buns on either side
                                of her head with short fringe-bangs falling over her forehead protector which she wears
                                in the traditional manner.Tenten strongly believes that female shinobi can be as strong
                                as male shinobi. During the Chūnin Exams, Neji suggests that kunoichi aren't good at
                                taijutsu, but Tenten reprimands him, explaining that girls are just as good as boys when
                                it comes to taijutsu. Tenten's personal dream is to become as powerful, legendary and
                                well noted female ninja as Tsunade. She can be quite fierce sometimes, especially with
                                Lee, violently shaking him whenever he is left unconscious, Naruto also describes her
                                personality as fierce and scary. She also says different stuff from what she thinks,
                                like when she called Lee and idiot and reckless but in reality she knew he would have
                                won against the Sound Nin if there weren't any distractions. Tenten also has shown a
                                strong distaste for weakness or being overly dependent on other people. Despite this,
                                she is not above showing a softer side when it comes to her team-mates. She holds great
                                respect for her former team-mate, Neji, and often helped him train like the time before
                                Neji's Chūnin Exams, she got him ready for his match.

                                David Martinez is a Latino teenager with light brown eyes and brown hair that he wears
                                in a quaffed hairstyle, with the sides shaved. He has a thin athletic build typical of a
                                teenager his age. David's typical style is Kitsch, sporting a black t-shirt, two golden
                                chain necklaces (one with a cross), gray cropped sweatpants with two yellow straps on
                                either side, and white tennis shoes with blue straps. Later on, he starts to wear his
                                mother's yellow EMT jacket with a blue luminescent collar on the inside of the material,
                                with a green logo painted on the back.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After being chipped in, David—while still expelled—returned the following day to the
                                academy, in search of a rematch with Katsuo. Utilizing his Sandevistan implant, David
                                easily floored Katsuo with a single blow to the head and broke his nose. Once returned
                                home, David stared at the urn holding his mother's ashes, when he received a call from
                                the academy's principal. The principal told David that his expulsion had been formally
                                processed, but before the principal could end his sentence, David ended the
                                conversation. The next morning, making his way to the academy, he noticed that the
                                mysterious girl was aboard the NCART train, stealing shards from unsuspecting corporate
                                employees on their way to City Center. The woman attempted to also take David's shards,
                                but was quickly intercepted by David utilizing his implant. He grasped her arm, which
                                she shrugged off and instead took him with her to the end of the cart, and interrogated
                                David on why he was messing with her “job”. After a short discussion, the two came to an
                                agreement to work together, Lucy taking on David as her trainee, and split their
                                earnings seventy-to-thirty. After a short confrontation with an ambulance worker who
                                wanted to steal David's Sandevistan to sell on the black market, David stays the night
                                at Lucy's apartment, where she tells him her dream of leaving Night City to live on the
                                moon, and shares a braindance with him. The two bond during this experience, but while
                                David is asleep Lucy calls her team of mercs to her apartment. Maine, Dorio, and Pilar
                                arrive and confront David about the stolen Sandevistan, which Gloria had originally
                                planned to sell to Maine. After David reveals that Gloria had died, and demonstrates an
                                extreme tolerance for cyberware, he's given a chance to join their group, on the
                                condition that he proves himself in a small-scale data heist.

                                Jin. Both Mugen and Jin accompany Fuu in her search for "the samurai who smells of

                                Mugen serves as a foil to Jin in terms of personality and disposition. His fighting

                                Kenma usually has a quiet, composed and analytical personality. He rarely loses his
                                temper, and usually does not get too excited or fired-up about most things; with a few
                                exceptions being video games, Hinata, Lev - in The Arrival of Haiba Lev (OVA), and
                                Yamamoto during their first year in high school.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because of his reserved nature, Kenma does not often voice his opinions since he is
                                afraid of what others might think of him and does not like standing out or being noticed
                                in any way. His shy tendencies also prevent him from being very approachable and because
                                of this, he has a difficult time making friends; with Kuroo being stated to have been
                                the only friend he's made since elementary school. He also is not fond of the authority
                                that comes with being an upperclassman and doesn't expect his junior's to automatically
                                respect him; often reminding Lev that he does not need to be so formal with him.

                                avoids. Therefore, he generally tries to keep his emotions in check.

                                He is rather socially awkward. He is incapable of "reading the atmosphere," which has
                                lead to him having a lack of friends.

                                Kurapika (クラピカ, Kurapika) is the last survivor of the Kurta Clan. He is a Blacklist
                                Hunter and current leader of the organization founded by Light Nostrade.
                                He is a member of the Zodiacs with the codename "Rat" (子ね, Ne). His goal is to avenge
                                his clan and recover the remaining Scarlet Eyes.

                                arcs. He was also the deuteragonist of the Hunter Exam arc.
                                Kurapika is a cool and intelligent individual, possessing vast knowledge. He is
                                reticent; not one to open up to people easily and quite judgmental. His distance from
                                others initially keeps him level-headed and moralistic, but his heart has been poisoned
                                with sadness and hatred. Having been traumatized from losing everyone he loved at the
                                age of twelve, Kurapika closes his heart to new people and remains introverted as to
                                stay focused on his goal.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                Shiemi Moriyama (杜山 しえみ, Moriyama Shiemi) is the daughter of the woman who runs an
                                Exorcist-only shop. Shiemi Moriyama is the tritagonist and lead heroine of the
                                manga/anime series Blue Exorcist. She is an Exwire at the True Cross Academy, and is
                                training to be a Tamer.
                                She is kind and has an abiding love of gardening, but often lacks confidence in herself.
                                Before the series, Shiemi never went out of her home and tended to the garden with her
                                grandmother. After her grandmother died, Rin and Yukio exorcise the demon that was
                                leeching her life force and she decides to become an Exorcist
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She is currently an Esquire and with Yukio's help, she later passes the exams to study
                                in the Academy's regular classes as well. Initially, Shiemi scored poorly in tests
                                despite her upbringing, but it was soon discovered that she was using the names that she
                                has created herself. After learning to use official names, Shiemi's grades went up.
                                At first while at the academy, Shiemi only talked with Rin and Yukio, but she eventually
                                comes to amicable terms with Ryuji, Konekomaru, and Renzo. She also earns Izumo's
                                friendship despite being initially used and mistreated by her. Shiemi becomes devastated
                                upon learning Rin's secret, feeling she is not trustworthy enough to them to have
                                initially included her with this knowledge.
                                However, on the Kyoto mission, she reconciles with Rin upon seeing how much he is
                                suffering as a result of his nature.[ch. 26] Shiemi has the talent to become a Tamer and
                                can summon a reliable Greenman spirit that can produce healing herbs and plant-related
                                barriers.
                                Shiemi is shown to have great inner strength as she can keep her Greenman around for
                                extended periods without tiring. Her Greenman is able to understand her way of naming
                                plants and is able to produce the correct one when asked.

                                Dracule "Hawk Eyes" Mihawk is a world-famous pirate who holds the title of "Strongest
                                Swordsman in the World".
                                He was one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, the first revealed and formally introduced,
                                until the group's dissolution.
                                In the past, Mihawk was known as the "Marine Hunter" and had a reputation for being the
                                rival of Shanks, one of the Four Emperors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                His place of residence was Kuraigana Island, on which he served during the two-year
                                timeskip
                                as Roronoa Zoro's master in his swordsmanship training.
                                Alongside fellow ex-Warlord Crocodile, Mihawk created an organization known as the Cross
                                Guild, with Buggy of the Four Emperors acting as the organization's figurehead leader.
                                Due to his status and title, Mihawk is viewed by Zoro as the ultimate obstacle to
                                achieve
                                his dream of becoming the world's strongest swordsman himself.
                                Mihawk can be considered a supporting antagonist of the Baratie Arc and one of the major
                                antagonists in the Marineford Arc, where he took part in the Summit War of Marineford on
                                the
                                side of the Marines, along with most of the other Warlords of the Sea.

                                Suzaku Kururugi (枢木 スザク / くるるぎすざく), Kururugi Suzaku), 17 years old (18 at R2), is the
                                deuteragonist of the Sunrise anime series Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, one of
                                the
                                antagonists of Code Geass: Akito the Exiled, and one of the protagonists of Code Geass:
                                Lancelot & Guren.
                            </p>

                                Suzaku is a young man with light brown hair and forest green eyes. He is rather tall,
                                being
                                slightly shorter than Lelouch. Like most characters in the series, he also is rather
                                skinny,
                                belying his extreme physical prowess. He is usually clothed in a white knightmare frame
                                battle suit or the Ashford Academy uniform, and is also seen wearing a prison outfit and
                                a
                                soldier's uniform on separate occasions. However, in the second, he often wears regal
                                clothing with a long blue cloak of the Knights of the Round which was more decorated and
                                ornamented upon becoming the Knight of Zero and a different knightmare battle suit. His
                                long
                                blue cloak becomes black upon becoming the Knight of Zero. <br>

                                Suzaku is the son of Japan's last prime minister, Genbu Kururugi. His existence was kept
                                a
                                secret from the public until after the war. Suzaku met Lelouch vi Britannia and his
                                sister
                                Nunnally vi Britannia when they moved to the Kururugi residence as a diplomatic peace
                                trade.
                                At first, Suzaku despised Lelouch because he thought that he was a prince who didn't
                                care
                                about anyone. As time passed by, however, he came to know Lelouch better, and they soon
                                became best friends.

                                Considered Goku's greatest foe and arch nemesis, he has made several comebacks since his
                                fight with Goku on Namek, including multiple invasions of Earth. Recently, he was chosen
                                to represent Universe 7 as the tenth member of Team Universe 7 for the Tournament of
                                Power as a replacement for Good Buu. This makes him the most recurring villain of the

                                underneath the school blazer, plaid pants for lower garments, and a pair of rubber shoes

                                attempts to become someone big in various areas like: soccer, acting, etc. but he lacks
                                all kind of talent and fails at everything, including simple things as map reading.

                                which descend from the lower part of his eyes. His facial expression rarely changes,
                                though he is almost always frowning. He wears typical Arrancar clothes: a white jacket,
                                black sash, and a white hakama. However, his jacket has longer coattails than others,
                                and the collar is higher.

                                located on the base of his throat.[5] The remainder of his Hollow mask lies on the
                                top-left side of his head, forming a broken horned helmet.[5] His Espada tattoo lies on
                                the left side of his ches

                                Alucard is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Hellsing manga and anime
                                series created by Kouta Hirano. A vampire devoted entirely to the current head of the
                                Hellsing family, Integra Hellsing, Alucard works with the Hellsing Organization against
                                other vampires and evil forces, fighting with ferocity and cruelty, sometimes only
                                killing after a target has been disabled and humiliated, while frequently allowing
                                enemies more than one chance to kill him (though only seeking to be killed by a human,
                                having grown bored of immortality and life). Count Dracula was defeated by Abraham Van
                                Helsing and became the family's loyal servant. Decades later, Abraham's direct
                                descendant Arthur Hellsing gives the Count the codename "Alucard". Hellsing is set over
                                a hundred years later, where Alucard and the Hellsing Organization are forced to fight
                                the remnants of a Nazi battalion. Alucard also appears in the prequel series Hellsing:
                                The Dawn, taking a female form alongside his partner Walter C. Dornez to end World War
                                II in a fight against Nazis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hirano created Alucard as a strong individual who would be deus ex machina on his own,
                                resulting in an easy defeat of most enemies. Alucard is voiced by Jouji Nakata in
                                Japanese and Crispin Freeman in English. Critical response to the character has been
                                positive for Alucard's dark traits such as sadism or supernatural abilities that make
                                him stand out as excessively violent despite being the main hero. Alucard's design also
                                stood out for being called "stylish", praising his outfits and weaponry. Alucard's voice
                                portrayals by Nakata and Freeman were also met with a positive response.

                                Houtarou Oreki (折木 奉太郎 Oreki Hōtarō) is the protagonist of Classic Literature Club
                                series and Hyouka.
                                He is a student of Kamiyama High School, and a member of the school's Classic Lit Club.
                                Houtarou is an apathetic person who prioritizes energy conservation above all else.
                                However, he possesses brilliant deduction skills, and he is often forced to use them by
                                the ever-curious Eru Chitanda.

                            <p> Houtarou is capable of appreciating praise, and has shown to have a tendency of exerting
                                more than what he would usually do when given positive feedback.
                                As stated by Chitanda, Oreki is humble, and does not brag about his ability to solve
                                mysteries, which possibly might be the main reason for Chitanda's admiration towards
                                him.

                                Despite his cute appearance, his voice is deep and gruff. In the anime, he revealed that
                                he used Floral Green shampoo (English TV: Minty Rain Forest Mist Shampoo with extra
                                bodywash), which is also used by Sakura, who was comically traumatised at the thought of
                                using the same shampoo as a dog.[4] In Japanese, Pakkun uses "washi" (ワシ) when referring
                                to himself, which is generally used by older men. Despite his lazy demeanour, Pakkun is
                                shown to be fiercely proud and determined ninken. When offered by Sai to deliver a
                                message with one of his ink creatures, Pakkun insisted that he deliver it, not wanting
                                to look inferior. He is very loyal to his allies and at times curses his inability to
                                get more directly involved in battle.

                                The Scarred Man (傷の男, Kizu no Otoko), known more casually as "Scar" (スカー, Sukā), is a
                                nameless lone serial killer and vigilante who targets State Alchemists for his own brand
                                of lethal justice in accordance with the fundamental tenets of his religion and for the
                                revenge of his slaughtered people and family. An Ishvalan survivor of the Ishvalan Civil
                                War, Scar's moniker comes from the large X-shaped scar on his forehead and sports a
                                conspicuous and intricate alchemical tattoo on his right arm, which originally belonged
                                to his older brother, and which he uses as his murder weapon of choice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Use of Alchemy -
                                While his physical prowess and intimidating figure are frightful in and of themselves,
                                Scar's most dangerous element is his right arm, which is able to destroy anything with
                                which it comes into contact by way of the intricate and arcane Transmutation Array
                                tattooed thereupon. As a fundamentalist opponent of alchemy, Scar does not consider
                                himself an alchemist in the traditional sense, but the strain of alchemy that his arm
                                itself allows him to produce is powerful, advanced and unique. As observed by those who
                                have seen it in action and lived to tell the tale, Scar's method follows the cyclical
                                flow of transmutation, but only takes into account the first two steps - comprehension
                                and deconstruction. By "stopping at the second step", the physical structure of whatever
                                he targets is broken down and not reshaped, essentially reducing it to debris. By
                                applying this method to his victims, he destroys their internal systems (general organs
                                in the manga, but the brain specifically in the 2003 anime version) instantly while
                                circumventing both Human Transmutation and the Ishvalan stigma associated with giving
                                new form to one of God's creations. In the 2003 anime, he is able to destroy Chimeras by
                                blowing them up, reducing their bodies to bloody splatters. Still, for all the serial
                                killer's anti-alchemical posturing, the fact that he is unable to deconstruct an object
                                whose composition he does not comprehend suggests that Scar does have a fair bit of
                                alchemical knowledge and must actively identify, or at least make educated guesses at,
                                the makeup of objects he wishes to destroy; despite his repeated assertion that the arm
                                (and not himself) is the one performing alchemy, Scar is an amateur alchemist by
                                practice.

                                Jin Kazama (Japanese: 風間 仁, Hepburn: Kazama Jin) is a fictional character of the Tekken
                                fighting game series created by Bandai Namco Entertainment. He was introduced as the
                                protagonist
                                in the 1997 game Tekken 3 and has been the central character of the series from that
                                game onwards. Trained by his grandfather Heihachi Mishima, Jin wishes to avenge the
                                apparent death of
                                his mother Jun Kazama. However, Heihachi betrays Jin to awaken a genetic abnormality
                                within his body known as the Devil Gene (Japanese: デビルの血, Hepburn: Debiru no Chi, lit.
                                "Devil's blood").

                                He is also antagonized by his father, Kazuya Mishima, from whom he inherited the gene.
                                While dealing with his relatives, Jin loses control of the Devil Gene, which causes his
                                transformation into
                                an alter ego named Devil Jin (Japanese: デビル仁, Hepburn: Debiru Jin), first introduced as
                                a non-playable character in Tekken 3 and playable ever since Tekken 5. Outside of the
                                video games, Jin has appeared in the animated and live-action films adapted from the
                                games and have also appeared as a playable character in several other game franchises.

                                Megumin (Japanese: めぐみん) is a character from the light novel, manga, and anime series
                                KonoSuba written by Natsume Akatsuki. In the universe of Konosuba, a parallel world with
                                MMORPG elements, Megumin is a sorcerer who joins protagonist Kazuma Sato's party in an
                                attempt to defeat the Devil King. Due to the party's dysfunctional abilities, Kazuma
                                quickly gives up on the idea of defeating the Devil King and tries to live a comfortable
                                lifestyle, only to find the circumstances of his daily life force him and his party to
                                encounter and battle the Devil King's generals.

                                Megumin has become a KonoSuba breakout character. Critical response to Megumin has been
                                positive, with particular praise focused on the humour of the character's gags. Rie
                                Takahashi's performance as the voice actress for Megumin has also been praised. The
                                character's popularity led to Megumin becoming the lead character in KonoSuba: God's
                                Blessing on This Wonderful World! Legend of Crimson, which explores her background as
                                well as a series of prequels detailing her past before meeting Kazuma's group.

                                Pikkon. Similar in appearance to a Namekian and with a similar moral stance to Goku,
                                Pikkon is the strongest student of the West Kai and competes with Goku during the Other
                                World Martial Arts Tournament. Surprisingly, Pikkon easily rivals Goku's Super Saiyan

                                demonstrated when he easily disposes of Frieza and Cell during their trouble-making

                                of the most interesting rarely seen characters in the anime. Although largely a filler
                                creation, Pikkon made a big impression during his fleeting appearances in the franchise
                                and it’s a shame that his presence is so limited.

                                «Sword Art Online» (SAO), «ALfheim Online» (ALO), as well as «Project

                                where she had temporarily used the Stacia (ステイシア, Suteishia?) account, is

                                heroine of the Sword Art Online series[7], the deuteragonist of the Aincrad

                                as the protagonist of the Mother's Rosario side story.

                                After Sword Art Online was cleared, Asuna transferred her SAO
                                avatar to ALfheim Online and began playing the game as an Undine.
                                Due to her tendency to charge into battle with a rapier despite being
                                a healer, she has earned the nickname «Berserk Healer» (バーサクヒーラー, Bāsaku
                                Hīrā?).[4]
                                Asuna has also created an alternative avatar, the Sylph «Erika» (エリカ,
                                Erika?), as she
                                sometimes wanted to change her appearance.

                                Mai Sakurajima (桜島 麻衣, Sakurajima Mai) is the main character of the Seishun
                                Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai series. She is a notable
                                actress/model and a third year at Minegahara High School, the same school as
                                Sakuta Azusagawa.

                                Mai is a serious individual, especially around Sakuta Azusagawa. She is very
                                sensitive, polite, levelheaded, helpful, and kind. She isn't harsh by
                                default, but she can become easily annoyed and come across as somewhat
                                snappy or violent especially to Sakuta. Mai tends to ignore and stuff down
                                unpleasant feelings rather than deal with them. Sakuta often points out that
                                she is "dishonest", often lying about her feelings. Despite her snarkiness,
                                she's pure-hearted and even shy around Sakuta's jokes. Mai is also very
                                intelligent; she's implied to have very good grades and even helps Sakuta
                                study at one point.

                                Chōji Akimichi (秋道チョウジ, Akimichi Chōji) is a member of Konohagakure's Akimichi Clan.
                                Though sensitive about his weight, Chōji is nevertheless dedicated to his friends,
                                especially in Team Asuma.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Chōji was born into the Akimichi clan, and is slated to become the Sixteenth Head of the
                                Akimichi (秋道16代目当主, Akimichi Jūrokudaime Tōshu) after his father, Chōza. When Chōji was
                                younger, he was often put down for not being good at a child's game called "Ninja",
                                which appears to be a cross between tag and hide and seek, often employing the use of
                                shuriken made out of cardboard and sticks. His peers would always berate him, telling
                                him that any team that he was on was bound to lose. One day, they simply refused to let
                                him play at all. However, Shikamaru Nara stuck up for him, saying that the teams would
                                be uneven if Chōji didn't join them. This gave Chōji a little hope, although, in the
                                end, they still refused to let him play.

                                Tomoe tends to be cunning and sly as well as seemingly unaware of his own attractiveness
                                but knows when to use his charms and handsome appearance when necessary to do so. He has
                                a tendency to mock others due to him not being able to trust others that easily, such as
                                at the beginning of the series where he said that there was no way a human girl like
                                Nanami Momozono could be a god. He was very cold and condescending towards Nanami at
                                first, but eventually warmed up to her and fell in love with her over time. Tomoe is
                                extremely powerful and is capable of using kitsunebi, or fox-fire as well as using
                                enchanted leaves to transform or control others.

                                He has a short temper, often shouting or telling Nanami off for being late home or for
                                being clumsy, and is also quite straightforward and blunt, telling Nanami that she is
                                annoying when she asked him about it one day. However, he has a strong sense of loyalty
                                and pride, as well as very protective towards those he cares about.

                                in the match. In 2005, he moved to
                                Gainare for the first time in 2 years. He played as regular player in 3 seasons. In

                                Trigun (Japanese: トライガン, Hepburn: Toraigan) is a Japanese manga series written and
                                illustrated by Yasuhiro Nightow. Trigun was first serialized in Tokuma Shoten's shōnen
                                manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Captain from April 1995 to January 1997, when the magazine
                                ceased its publication; its chapters were collected in three tankōbon volumes. The
                                series continued its publication in Shōnen Gahosha's seinen manga magazine Young King
                                OURs, under the title Trigun Maximum

                                Set on the fictional planet known as No Man's Land, the plot follows Vash the Stampede,
                                a famous gunman who is constantly fighting bounty hunters seeking to obtain the immense
                                bounty on his head. As the narrative progresses, Vash's past is explored. Trigun
                                originated from Nightow's fascination with Western movies.

                                Annie Leonhart (アニ・レオンハート Ani Reonhāto?) is a graduate of the 104th Cadet
                                Corps and former member of the Military Police Regiment. Her exceptional
                                skill with swords and unarmed combat earned her the 4th rank, but she is
                                noted to be a lone wolf that struggles to work with others.

                                Titan. She trained from an early age by her father, and is selected as
                                one of Marley's Warriors. In the year 845, she is sent on a mission to
                                retrieve the Founding Titan, along with her fellow Warriors Reiner Braun,
                                Bertholdt Hoover, and Marcel Galliard. As the Female Titan, she served as a
                                major antagonist prior to being exposed and defeated by the Scout Regiment.
                                After her defeat, she crystallized herself and was left in a comatose state.
                                She was held underground for approximately four years before escaping during
                                a battle between the Military, the Jaegerists, and the forces of Marley.

                                of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, and Portgas D. Rouge. Ace was

                                execution. Ace was the 2nd division commander of the Whitebeard
                                Pirates and one-time captain of the Spade Pirates.

                                Hunted by the World Government for his lineage, Ace was captured and
                                sentenced to death, which resulted in the Summit War of Marineford, an
                                all-out clash of powers; Whitebeard's forces against the Marines and Seven

                                from Marine Admiral Akainu.

                                Pariston has medium-length, dark blond hair and brown eyes. He is known for his wide,
                                cheerful smiles. Unlike many of the other members of the Zodiacs, he does not change his
                                appearance to look like the animal that he represents. Instead, Pariston is always seen
                                wearing luxurious suits and ties.

                                Due to his extreme unpredictability, slyness, shadiness and the tendency to test
                                anyone's patience and temper, he is disliked by all of the Zodiacs and many Hunters in
                                the Association, even more than Ging. Even Morel states that he would rather die than
                                vote for a slew rat-like Pariston. It is also shown that Netero also cannot stand him
                                and often gets into a lot of arguments with him, but he tolerates Pariston's presence
                                because he believes that a yes-man second-in-command is too boring for him.

                                Killer B (キラービー, Kirā Bī, Viz: Killer Bee) is a shinobi from Kumogakure. He is the most
                                recent jinchūriki of the Eight-Tails, Gyūki, though, unlike his predecessors, he was
                                able to befriend it and hone its power for Kumo's benefit. Despite being responsible for
                                the village's protection, B aspires to be the world's greatest rapper.

                                At a young age, he was along with several other children who were gathered by the Third
                                Raikage and Dodai in order to select a tag partner for his son A. Out of all the
                                children gathered, he was the only person able to successfully perform the Lightning
                                Release: Double Lariat with A. As such he was given the name "B", and A stated they
                                would be brothers from that day on.[2] Since the age of five, B has been best friends
                                with Motoi, whom he always greeted with a fist bump. After A's cousin, the jinchūriki of
                                Gyūki lost control and killed Motoi's father along with seven other ninja on that day, B
                                was chosen as its next jinchūriki.[3] Soon afterwards, B suffered from similar
                                prejudices against jinchūriki, not too different from that the villagers of Konohagakure
                                and Sunagakure had against Naruto Uzumaki and Gaara respectively. However, he kept
                                smiling and pushed himself to be the best jinchūriki that he could be, so that his
                                brother wouldn't be hurt politically as the Fourth Raikage.

                                (霧隠れの鬼人, Kirigakure no Kijin), was a missing-nin from Kirigakure's Seven Ninja Swordsmen
                                of the Mist.

                                Before the term of the Fourth Mizukage, Yagura Karatachi, Kirigakure began the practice
                                of pitting Kirigakure Academy graduates against each other in death matches as a final
                                exam with the exceptionally skilled students named prime candidates for the Seven Ninja
                                Swordsmen of the Mist. After Zabuza, not yet a student himself, killed over one hundred
                                Academy students,[5] the practice was discontinued and he would thereafter be known as
                                the "Demon of the Hidden Mist". His fame grew over the years as he became an Anbu,
                                killing the Konohagakure ninja Kumade Toriichi at that time, before finally joining the
                                Seven Swordsmen. At some point, he discovered Haku, a child with a special kekkei genkai
                                and began training him to be the ultimate weapon. In the anime, he and Haku witnessed
                                the Kaguya clan attacking Kirigakure yet chose not to help his village. Soon after, they
                                encountered Kimimaro, the soon-to-be-sole survivor of the Kaguya. Although Haku wanted
                                to talk to the boy, Zabuza forced him to leave Kimimaro alone and keep moving.

                                some of whom possessed kekkei genkai. After the war ended, memories of the horrific
                                battles still lingered in the minds of the people. Those with kekkei genkai quickly
                                became feared and hated for their abilities, out of concern that their existence would
                                only bring about more war.

                                Tenten (テンテン, Tenten) is a kunoichi from Konohagakure and a member of Team Guy. While
                                initially wanting to be like the legendary Sannin Tsunade, she realised that she did not
                                have the necessary chakra control to be a medical-nin. However, she did not give up on
                                being a powerful kunoichi, putting her all into perfecting her weaponry and fūinjutsu
                                skills.
                            </p>

                                Since her time as a student in the Academy, Tenten had a goal to become a legendary
                                kunoichi like Tsunade, one of the Sannin, which she openly shared to others. After
                                graduating, she was assigned to the jōnin tutelage of Might Guy, alongside her
                                classmates Rock Lee and Neji Hyūga. For their final test to become genin, Guy forced his
                                potential students to spar him and see their commitment to succeed. Ultimately, all
                                three passed.[6] During this time of trial and failure, trying to emulate Tsunade,
                                Tenten attempted to become a medical-nin, building up her raw strength and such. While
                                each failed attempt was damaging to her pride, Tenten later discovered her talent for
                                fūinjutsu and thus developed her unique fighting style. Realising her own nature, she
                                stopped trying to become like Tsunade, but still has not given up on her dream of
                                becoming a legendary kunoichi in her own right.[7] Later, Tenten and her teammates were
                                offered the chance to enter the Chūnin Exams in the possibility of being promoted to
                                said rank. However, all three decided to pass on the exams for the time being to further
                                hone their skills.

                                always been with since the two met. They often spend their time going on walks, or more
                                accurately, running through trees chasing one another. His devotion is most often seen
                                when Kiba is hurt in battle; Akamaru will immediately run to his side.

                                "Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior
                                Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the crew's eighth member and the seventh to
                                join, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Born "Cutty Flam" he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until eventually
                                permanently discarding his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity.
                                Originally from the South Blue, Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old,
                                eventually making his way to Water 7. There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers,
                                until an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged and requiring him to
                                augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the leader of the
                                Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty hunters.

                                Light is characterized as hardworking, talented, and a natural genius. Highly perceptive

                                scenarios. Furthermore, Light is very popular among peers and adored by his family
                                members. However, his high intelligence and constant praise from adults laid the
                                foundation for an intense level of hubris which quickly took effect once he obtained the
                                notebook.

                                Light is a young man, standing at above average height with light-brown hair and brown
                                eyes. During Part I, when not wearing his school uniform, which consists of a tan suit
                                and red tie, he dresses fairly casually, sometimes sporting a dress shirt underneath a
                                jacket or a V-neck sweater with a collared t-shirt underneath. During Part II, if not
                                wearing a similar style of clothes, he is seen wearing a suit.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                Hidan (飛段, Hidan) is an S-rank missing-nin who defected from Yugakure and later joined
                                the Akatsuki, and a worshipper of Jashin.
                                There, he was partnered with Kakuzu, despite the two's somewhat mutual dislike of each
                                other. He was also the second newest
                                member of Akatsuki at the time of Tobi's introduction. Kisame Hoshigaki laughingly
                                referred to Hidan and Kakuzu as the Zombie
                                Combo

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using his weapon, Hidan makes every attempt to acquire an opponent's blood where, upon
                                consuming, it he draws the Jashin symbol on the
                                ground. This process somehow "links" his body with his opponent's. Once this link is
                                established, Hidan takes on a Grim Reaper-like
                                appearance, with black skin and white bone-like markings.
                                Despite its effectiveness, the curse has many requirements, and can be a slow technique
                                to employ. The curse can be avoided if
                                the opponent happens to know what to look out for, and knows of Hidan's inability to
                                die. The link between Hidan's curse and his
                                opponent could be broken prematurely if Hidan was removed from the symbol; However,
                                Hidan would remain in his transformed
                                state, allowing the curse to be easily re-established by him simply entering the
                                symbol's borders once more.

                                Asuma Sarutobi (猿飛アスマ, Sarutobi Asuma) was a jōnin of Konohagakure's Sarutobi clan and a
                                former member of the Twelve Guardian Ninja.
                                He was also the leader of Team 10 which consists of Shikamaru Nara, Ino Yamanaka, and
                                Chōji Akimichi.
                                Though somewhat understated, the legacy Asuma left behind was one of great value. Within
                                Konoha, and the wider shinobi world he
                                left a sterling record of military prowess which many young Konoha shinobi look up to,
                                wanting to emulate. He is also forever
                                recognised for this prowess having been selected as one of the twelve people deemed
                                strong enough to protect the leader of their
                                country.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along with this, Asuma was also responsible for training the current generation of the
                                famed Ino–Shika–Chō trio who are the future leaders of their respective clans as well as
                                completing the all-important ceremony concerning the three clans and the
                                Sarutobi. He was also integral in assisting Naruto Uzumaki with his nature
                                transformation training with Wind Release. Asuma left behind lover Kurenai Yūhi whom he
                                fathered a child with. This child he views as his "king" whom he asked his student
                                Shikamaru to protect with his dying breath and years later his daughter would follow the
                                footsteps of him and Asuma's father

                                Killer B is a major supporting character in the anime and manga Naruto Shippuden. He is
                                the host of Gyuki, The Eight-tailed demon Ox.
                                He was a shinobi who trained Naruto and is partners with him while fighting Obito
                                Uchiha.
                                Killer B is very proud of his own power and by extension of who he is, regardless of his
                                status and upbringing as a jinchūriki.
                                Like Naruto Uzumaki, who has great overconfidence at times, Killer B can be quite cocky
                                and stubborn, especially in terms of his
                                own strength, demanding respect from others and asks to be called "Lord Jinchūriki"
                                (人柱力様, Jinchūriki-sama) and his tailed
                                beast be called "Lord Eight-Tails" (八尾様, Hachibi-sama).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                B has a special way of expressing his pride through song, more specifically in rap-style
                                and tends to use "Bakayarō! Konoyarō!"
                                (「バカヤロー!コノヤロー!, Viz: Fool! Ya Fool!) when referring or speaking to others. He will even
                                write his rhymes in the middle
                                of a fight, or during an important meeting, even if they are no good, which is usually
                                the case.

	            	<p>
            		  Discerning, intelligent, and widely respected, Erwin was an able commander. While he cared deeply for his men, 
                  he did not hesitate to sacrifice them for the good and prosperity of mankind, and his men proved more than 
                  willing to stake their lives at his order. During Erwin's career he developed the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting 
                  Formation, and due to uncertainty about his future, he later named Hange Zoë as his successor.

                             After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage.

                                Teito Klein is a former slave who now attends the Barsburg Empire's military academy due to his ability to use a rare and highly prized type of supernatural force known as Zaiphon.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Teito is an amnesiac who frequently has frightening dreams. The night before the graduation exam, 
                                Teito and his only friend, Mikage, vow they will never abandon each other. 
                                The next day, Teito overhears people talking about him. Stopping to listen, 
                                he suddenly realizes that the speaker, Chief of Staff Ayanami, 
                                is the person who killed the familiar man in his dreams: His father, 
                                the king of the destroyed Raggs Kingdom. 
                                Teito is caught eavesdropping and tries to attack Ayanami but is quickly brought down by one of his subordinates and sent to prison. 
                                Mikage comes to help him escape, only to find that Teito has managed to fight past the guards all by himself. 
                                The two flee the building, but are cornered on a balcony. Teito pretends to hold Mikage hostage, then makes his escape, 
                                though he is wounded by a Zaiphon blast that Ayanami directs at him. Three bishops in the nearby 7th District discover the injured Teito and take him to a nearby church to recuperate, 
                                where he's protected because of the 7th District's law of sanctuary. In due time, it is discovered that Teito carries the Eye of Mikhail, a powerful talisman for which his home country was destroyed. 
                                This fact, as well as a fateful reunion, catapults Teito into a quest for revenge against the Barsburg Empire and for knowledge about his past. At the same time, 
                                his status as the bearer of the Eye of Mikhail throws him into the long-standing conflict with the evil Verloren and his enemies, the 07 Ghosts.

He originally served as the primary antagonist of the Hunter Exam arc and the Heavens Arena arc, before becoming a supporting character during the Yorknew City arc and Greed Island arc. During the 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc, he reprises his role as a secondary antagonist.

                                            was a killer who wouldn't kill anymore. After years of being a hired sword and killing countless foes, he makes a vow to
                                            never deal in death again. But his vow is tested time and time again as less virtuous people endanger the country's

                                        Kenshin was a refreshing change of pace in the samurai genre of his time. He was quite feminine, often mistaken for a
                                        woman by viewers who weren't in the know. He was also one of the most polite characters in anime history, frequently
                                        putting others before himself and speaking to them with the utmost respect and patience. On the surface, he's a model
                                        nice guy, the kind of person you'd expect to be a teacher or a florist, not a warrior trying to atone for years of
                                        bloodshed.

                            Power has the appearance of a young woman with mid-back length hair. Her hair color varies from blonde to pink in manga illustrations, and appears blonde with a pinkish tint in the anime.

                            As a fiend, she has red and yellow eyes that form a cross pattern, sharp teeth with defined fangs, and light red horns protruding from the top of her head. If Power accumulates too much blood, her horns become larger and more curved, and she can sprout additional pairs of horns from the sides of her head.[2]

Power usually wears the standard dress shirt, tie, and slacks required of Public Safety Demon Hunters. Normally, she wears breast pads to increase the size of her bust. She almost always wears her jacket hanging halfway off her body giving her an untidy, half-dressed appearance.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Power has the appearance of a young woman with mid-back length hair. Her hair color varies from blonde to pink in manga illustrations, and appears blonde with a pinkish tint in the anime. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a fiend, she has red and yellow eyes that form a cross pattern, sharp teeth with defined fangs, and light red horns protruding from the top of her head. If Power accumulates too much blood, her horns become larger and more curved, and she can sprout additional pairs of horns from the sides of her head.[2]

Power usually wears the standard dress shirt, tie, and slacks required of Public Safety Demon Hunters. Normally, she wears breast pads to increase the size of her bust. She almost always wears her jacket hanging halfway off her body giving her an untidy, half-dressed appearance.

                            Makima is one of the strongest individuals in the world of the Chainsaw Man thanks to her physical and supernatural abilities as a devil, along with her cunning and manipulative personality. She is feared by humans, fiends and devils all around the world, which also increased her powers as a devil.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a devil, Makima possesses all of the standard devil abilities. These include the ability to make contracts with humans. Thanks to her ability to control humans, she is also able to force them to make a contract with herself. Makima has a contract with the Prime Minister of Japan in exchange of working for Japan. As a result of her contract with the Prime Minister, any fatal damage inflicted to Makima is transferred into an appropriate illness or ailment affecting a random citizen of Japan. She was shown to have been shot in the back of the head and seemingly killed, only to stand up later with no visible wounds. She stated that she was merely grazed by a bullet, however, this is unlikely given the placement of the gun when it was fired, as well as the location of the blood from the exit wound

                <p class="card-text">
                    Denji, also known as Chainsaw Man, is the titular main protagonist of the 2018 dark fantasy manga series Chainsaw Man and its 2022 anime television series adaptation of the same name. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a young boy, he inherits his father's debts from the Yakuza. After meeting Pochita, he becomes a Devil Hunter for the Yakuza in an attempt to clear his debt. 
                    Using his pet devil Pochita as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for a bit of cash.
                    Denji has a simple dream—to live a happy and peaceful life, spending time with a girl he likes. This is a far cry from reality, however, as Denji is forced by the yakuza into killing devils in order to pay off his crushing debts. 
                    Once the Yakuza, under the control of a Devil, betrays him, he dies and Pochita becomes his heart. He now becomes the Chainsaw Man by pulling a cord on his chest. After meeting Makima, he became a Public Safety Devil Hunter. 
                    Now with the means to face even the toughest of enemies, Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his simple teenage dreams.

                    Kiyo Takamine (高嶺 清麿, Takamine Kiyomaro) began the series as an ordinary 14-year old high school student who happens to have an IQ over 180.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His intelligence makes him a target for teasing and harassment. Due to this bullying, and to his own arrogance, Kiyo develops an introverted and apathetic demeanor, to the point where he skips school on a regular basis. 
                    However, his entire lifestyle changes when he receives a rather unusual birthday present given by his father: A mamodo kid named Zatch Bell. 
                    Together, they fight in the Battle to Decide the Mamodo King and are the main characters throughout most of the storyline.
