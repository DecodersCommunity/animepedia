                                <p class="card-text">
                                    Satoru Gojo is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a
                                    special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world.
                                    Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first
                                    person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He
                                    works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and
                                    train strong young allies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Satoru is a tall man with a lean build in his later twenties who is considered
                                    relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and
                                    the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru
                                    normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold which props up his hair and gives it
                                    a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses
                                    and let his hair down to reach the base of his
                                    neck. While working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high collar
                                    that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit matching black pants and black dress
                                    boots.

                                <p class="card-text">Naruto Uzumaki is the main protagonist in the popular manga and
                                    anime series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                                    strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of
                                    Konoha (or Leaf Village).</p>
                                <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's
                                    chakra, which is much greater than
                                    the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely
                                    grant Naruto his power unless they
                                    were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the
                                    fox by his name, Kurama. At this
                                    point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Konan was smart, stoic, calm, and level-headed much like her
                                    partner, Nagato. As a child, she was bright, compassionate, and relatively cheerful,
                                    in comparison to Yahiko's tough attitude and Nagato's sensitivity. However, the
                                    traumatic events since then have led her to become a very serious person, and she
                                    never spoke during Akatsuki meetings. Nevertheless, she has always placed the safety
                                    of her team-mates above her own. Konan had romantic feelings towards Yahiko, which
                                    were reciprocated.[11]

                                    She did seem to be more empathetic than most other Akatsuki members, as she appeared
                                    sad whenever she was reminded of her past. She also expressed a great deal of
                                    loyalty and courtesy to Pain, doing his bidding without question, looking out for
                                    his well-being and always having complete faith in his abilities. She acted as an
                                    intermediary between Pain and Ame, the villagers having given her the title "God's
                                    Angel", because with her paper wings activated, she resembles one.

                                    Kishimoto.



                                    Mei Terumi worked really hard after becoming the Fifth Mizukage in order to make
                                    sure she became a good leader and led her Shinobis in the right direction. She was
                                    one of the kages who fought in the Fourth Shinobi War.

                                <p class="card-text">
                                    Kurama (九喇嘛, Kurama), more commonly known as the Nine-Tails (九尾, Kyūbi), was one of
                                    the nine tailed beasts. Centuries of being regarded as a mindless monster and sought
                                    after as a tool for war caused Kurama to hate humans. After being sealed into Naruto
                                    Uzumaki, Kurama attempts to maintain its cynical perspective about the world, but
                                    with Naruto's insistence on treating it with respect, the fox overturns its hatred
                                    and willingly strives to use its power for the world's salvation.
                                    Kurama and the tailed beasts first came into being in the waning days of Hagoromo
                                    Ōtsutsuki, who used his Creation of All Things Technique to divide the Ten-Tails'
                                    chakra into nine separate bodies and giving them each a name. Some time after being
                                    created, the Sage explained to the young tailed beasts that a link existed between
                                    them despite their separation. He also foretold of a day when they would be brought
                                    together again - though not as they were - and that at that time someone would
                                    emerge to show them what true power is In the anime, before his death,
                                    Hagoromo sent Kurama to live in a temple built for the purpose of protecting it in a
                                    forest region with mountains that would later become part of the Land of Fire.
                                    Over time, Kurama gained a fearsome reputation as a natural disaster that can
                                    desolate areas where the darkest aspects of human nature collect and fester.

                                    as many One Piece fans tend to think that it is a representation of a character's

                                    new bounty that has sparked many debates as it is lower than Zoro and Jimbei's

                                    He has an even expression despite his great abilities, ranging from fighting to

                                    series created by One. It tells the story of Saitama, a superhero who, because he
                                    can defeat any opponent with a single punch, grows bored from a lack of challenge.
                                    One wrote the original webcomic manga version in early 2009.

                                    Lelouch was one of the best examples of a hero gone astray. As often happens in
                                    dramatic stories, his good intentions paved a road to a dark place.
                                    His rise and downfall is almost Shakespearean in nature, as his own pride and
                                    arrogance cloud his judgment and he misses out on what was truly important.
                                    But at least he did it all with a sense of dramatic flair! His alter ego Zero,
                                    complete with mysterious helmet and flowing cape, was an iconic tool to secure a
                                    place in the psyche of both his enemies and his followers.
                                    In the end, Lelouch's plans are successful, though not in the way anyone ever
                                    expected.

                                    unsurprising.

                                    After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission
                                    in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a
                                    ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki,
                                    Sasuke starts developing his skills.

                                    strength needed to exact his revenge. His years of seeking vengeance and his actions
                                    that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from
                                    others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the
                                    truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth
                                    Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to
                                    Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants,
                                    becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage".

                                    an ideal world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ，Tobi) and Madara Uchiha
                                    himself, Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance

                                    Kaidou was drafted against his will by the Marines but managed to escape and start a
                                    career in piracy. He was invited by Edward Newgate to join the legendary Rocks
                                    Pirates as an apprentice, where he met and befriended Charlotte Linlin. During the

                                    However, after training under the Sannin Tsunade, she overcomes this, and becomes

                                    Rock Lee (ロック・リー, Rokku Rī) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Lee clan and a member of
                                    Team Guy. Unlike most shinobi, he lacked the skills necessary to use ninjutsu or
                                    genjutsu. However, he overcomes those shortcomings by undergoing special training
                                    from Might Guy that would make him a taijutsu master while still a genin.

                                    his promises; when this promise is broken, just barely, he assigns himself arduous
                                    training to prevent it from happening again.

                                    than Tokyo Ghoul's Ken Kaneki. The one-eyed ghoul's story is truly a tragedy, but
                                    fans admire him for several reasons. Many consider Kaneki one of the best anime
                                    protagonists of all time.</p>

                                <p>Ken Kaneki is a man of many layers, and just as many flaws. Kaneki's journey in Tokyo
                                    Ghoul is one of suffering, pain, and a gruesome, nightmarish reality. The series
                                    depicts a constant tug-of-war between Kaneki's ghoul side fighting against his
                                    humanity..</p>

                                    period of four years. Near takes his findings to the President of

                                    and reveals himself to be the true successor of L. Soon after, Near

                                    contact with "L" (Light Yagami), Near begins to suspect that he is

                                    three years after the end of the Kira case, Near is shown to have

                                    Minato Namikaze is known to be the strongest ninja who ever lived.
                                    He was born on January 25th, 12 years before the start of the
                                    series. He was hailed as a hero for his bravery and quick thinking
                                    during a conflict with an unknown, powerful force.


                                    On October 10th, Minato Namikaze died while defending the village

                                    In the early ’70s, anime was still gaining a foothold as a legitimate and profitable
                                    form of entertainment.
                                    It was still largely seen as a vehicle for either dramatic stories, or children's
                                    tales, but Lupin brought adult comedy anime into the forefront. Although his
                                    adult-oriented themes took a while to catch on, eventually his lecherous antics and
                                    suave handling of epic heists brought grown-ups firmly into anime and proved to
                                    Japanese studio execs that this kind of title could make them money. From Rome, to
                                    Paris, to Rio, Lupin traveled far and wide in search of booty… both kinds.
                                    It was Lupin's love of women and his dirty mind that provided much of the comedy in
                                    the series, and it was the first time racy humor found itself in popular anime.

                                    But the most beautiful part of the anime version of Lupin is that he's much more
                                    chivalrous than his manga counterpart.
                                    The anime version of the character was much more appropriate for the times and fir
                                    his role as a leading man of anime.

                                    Temari is one of the main supporting characters in the Naruto anime and manga series
                                    and the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime and manga series.

                                    She is a jōnin-level kunoichi of Sunagakure and one of the three Sand Siblings.

                                    Temari is the eldest child and only daughter of the Fourth Kazekage, and the older
                                    sister of Kankuro and Gaara.
                                <p>
                                    Temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not
                                    being afraid to speak her mind. One of the few things shown to intimidate her is her
                                    younger brother Gaara. She very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding
                                    attitude, when around the boy, due to the fear of Gaara's wrath. Temari does have a
                                    caring side, and is not above showing concern for others. She is often seen with
                                    Shikamaru. Temari is a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's strategies
                                    and weaknesses soon after a battle begins. For actual combat she uses her giant iron
                                    fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide upon in
                                    order to intimidate her foes.
                                    Sometime after The Fourth Shinobi War, Temari marries Shikamaru Nara and gave birth
                                    their first and only son, Shikadai.
                                    She is voiced by Romi Park in the Japanese version of the anime who also voiced
                                    Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist, Tōshirō Hitsugaya, from Bleach. and by Tara

                                    fictional character in the manga and
                                    anime franchise, Naruto, created by Masashi
                                    Kishimoto. In the anime and manga,
                                    Shikamaru is a ninja affiliated with the village
                                    Hidden in the Leaves. He is a

                                    himself, Choji Akimichi, Ino

                                    is portrayed as a lazy
                                    character, unwilling to apply his prodigious
                                    intelligence.

                                    Shikamaru Nara is one of the smartest characters in
                                    the anime manga series Naruto.
                                    Masashi Kishimoto originally created Shikamaru in
                                    order for him to be the only
                                    winner of an early Naruto arc: the Chunin Exams,
                                    based on his high intelligence.
                                    However, recommendations from his editors resulted
                                    in Kishimoto deciding to
                                    interrupt the fighting tournament between the ninjas
                                    in order to focus on a recently
                                    introduced villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless,
                                    Shikamaru ends up becoming the only
                                    ninja from the original test to achieve a higher
                                    rank during Part I of the series.

                                    Trunks resembles Vegeta. For the
                                    majority of the Buu Saga, Present Trunks wears a
                                    dark green gi, an orange belt,

                                    - Second Coming, Trunks wears a
                                    light green long sleeve hoodie with a black short

                                    Trunks is born in November of Age 766 to Vegeta and
                                    Bulma, thus making him a Saiyan
                                    and Human hybrid, like Gohan. He was an illegitimate
                                    child due to the fact that he
                                    was conceived as a result of a brief affair between
                                    his parents. In his infancy, he
                                    was well-loved and doted on by his mother, but it
                                    appeared as if his father had
                                    little to no parental emotions towards the boy due
                                    to the former never wanting to
                                    have children and viewing hybrids as a disgrace.
                                    However, after the end of the Cell
                                    Games, the relationship between his parents improved
                                    and they got married, and they
                                    began raising Trunks as a family.

                                    Rudeus is a tall (175cm), well-built, and
                                    cool-looking man. He was born with brown hair, but
                                    after his second encounter with Orsted, his hair
                                    temporarily became white. His eyes are also slightly
                                    mismatched as he switched both of his eyes out for
                                    demon eyes. Like Paul, he also has a mole underneath
                                    his left eye.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Because of his former life, he is careful not to get
                                    carried away and become arrogant. As a result, he is
                                    extremely self-aware and humble because he does not
                                    want to revert to his old self. He is a kind person,
                                    helping his friends and protecting his family
                                    whenever needed. Due to being capable in many
                                    fields, people have high expectations of him. Rudeus
                                    is very polite to others, often making them
                                    uncomfortable.

                                    Kakashi Hatake is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake
                                    clan. Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan , he is one
                                    of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to
                                    for advice and leadership despite his personal
                                    dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team
                                    7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he
                                    himself received this lesson, along with the
                                    Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha.
                                    After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes
                                    Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage,
                                    literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).

                                    Kakashi became a Jonin and was sent on a mission
                                    along with Obito and Rin, They where to destroy a
                                    bridge that was being used by enemy forces to enter
                                    Konoha and therefore help in the third great shinobi
                                    war effort. But disaster struck when Rin was taken
                                    by two Iwagakure Jonin. Obito wanted to rescue his
                                    teammate; But Kakashi said that the mission came
                                    first. Kakashi found himself in the same situation
                                    as his father had been in the past and did not want
                                    to make the mistakes that his father had. Obito
                                    disagreed and left Kakashi not before telling him
                                    that what his father did in the past made him a hero
                                    not a disgrace.

                                    Shinichi took the appearance of his six or seven-year-old self after being exposed
                                    to a prototype poison
                                    called APTX 4869, which he had been forced to swallow by two men in black later
                                    revealed to be members of
                                    the Black Organization. The poison de-aged Shinichi's entire body except for his
                                    nervous system and therefore
                                    he still has the personality, memories, and incredible deductive ability of his
                                    teenage self.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As Conan, Shinichi helps Ran's father solve cases by putting him to sleep and
                                    simulating Kogoro's voice using
                                    the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him. He also spends a good amount
                                    of time with his Detective
                                    Boys fellows and solves many small cases with them and sometimes in the company of
                                    Professor Agasa.

                                    Anthy Himemiya (also known as Himemiya Ansh) is a mysterious girl who is considered
                                    to be a girl who has no ideas or desires other than what her current master expects
                                    of her. She often becomes the subject of other characters' fury because she tends to
                                    act like a "doormat" and take what they want or desire. Her personality alternates
                                    between unselfish love, passive-aggressive revenge, and taught helplessness. Her
                                    past and present selves are tragic and spiteful. Anthy, like Utena Tenjou, both
                                    defies and fits the preconceptions that she represents as both a princess and a
                                    witch.

                                    Anthy seems to be South Asian and perhaps of Indian ancestry. She wears a bindi mark
                                    or jewel and is notably darker than the others.

                                    Born on May 19th RY 351 / SY 2132, Shin lived with his family in the First Sector of
                                    the Republic before the war with the Giadian Empire began. It is implied he lived a
                                    sheltered life, surrounded by "only kindness and affection". He also appeared to
                                    have developed his extrasensory ability early on, hearing "voices that spoke without
                                    words" from his family.He would often play with the daughter of his father's
                                    colleague, Henrietta von Penrose, whom Shin called Rita.
