                            <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's chakra, which is much greater than the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant Naruto his power
                                unless they were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by his name, Kurama. At this point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                                Satoru Gojo is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless
                                and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.

                            <p>
                                Satoru is a tall man with a lean build in his later twenties who is considered relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black
                                blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of his neck. While working, Satoru wears a dark
                                blue zip-up jacket with a high collar that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit matching black pants and black dress boots.

                                Akuto has an incredible amount of power within him that sometimes gets out of control. Akuto has a highly serious personality but not without some humor. In the manga, he has much more of a temper, and, in a fight, is unwilling to hold anything back.
                                In the anime, he tries to restrain himself in order to convince everyone that he has no desire to be the Demon King. Powers: Akuto is capable of controlling and manipulating "mana", a magical energy that resides in the
                                bodies of living things and in surroundings. For instance, he is able to absorb the mana of a large demon dog, thus transforming it back into a normal puppy, a feat that has never been performed before. However, his immense
                                power is also highly volatile and most of his early attempts at controlling mana and creating magical projectiles, no matter how benign they are supposed to be, resulted in catastrophic explosions. His name is phonetically
                                very similar to a Japanese phrase meaning "Great/Ultimate villain".

                                Vinsmoke Sanji, also known as "Black Leg" Sanji, is a fictional character in the One Piece franchise created by Eiichiro Oda. A native to the North Blue, Sanji grew up as part of the Vinsmoke family under his father Vinsmoke Judge, king of the Germa Kingdom,
                                and mother Vinsmoke Sora.

                                With the Straw Hats taking down the Beasts Pirates, they have once again caught the eye of the World Government, who wasted no time in issuing new bounties to the crew. The bounty system has caused controversies in the past as many One Piece fans tend
                                to think that it is a representation of a character's power. This time, it is Sanji's new bounty that has sparked many debates as it is lower than Zoro and Jimbei's bounties.

                                most powerful heroes.[4][5] She is an esper and the older sister and self-declared teacher of Fubuki. She and her sister are known as the Psychic Sisters (エスパー姉妹, Esupā Shimai)

                                Tatsumaki has a rather brash, moody, hotheaded, and impatient personality. She is disrespectful towards most people, especially to those she deems incompetent. She is completely intolerant to those she deems impertinent, as shown when she slammed Genos
                                into a large piece of rubble for retaliating against her verbal abuse of Saitama.[8] However, she did stop when Bang scolded her for her actions to him.[8] Tatsumaki especially dislikes being ignored or being called things
                                like "brat" and "runt"

                                Lelouch was one of the best examples of a hero gone astray. As often happens in dramatic stories, his good intentions paved a road to a dark place. His rise and downfall is almost Shakespearean in nature, as his own pride and arrogance cloud his judgment
                                and he misses out on what was truly important. But at least he did it all with a sense of dramatic flair! His alter ego Zero, complete with mysterious helmet and flowing cape, was an iconic tool to secure a place in the
                                psyche of both his enemies and his followers. In the end, Lelouch's plans are successful, though not in the way anyone ever expected.

                                Near takes his findings to the President of the United States and reveals himself to be the true successor of L. Soon after, Near becomes the head of the Special Provision for Kira and continues the hunt for Kira. After
                                making contact with "L" (Light Yagami), Near begins to suspect that he is also Kira.

                                light blue. In the Death Note One-Shot Special, which takes place three years after the end of the Kira case, Near is shown to have sharp bags under his eyes, slightly longer hair, and to have undergone a growth spurt.
                                He sits in a posture similar to L's and is often seen being expressionless.

                                having become so powerful that no battle thrilled him. His intergalactic travels in search of a worthy opponent led him to Earth, where he was killed by Saitama.[4]

                                Because of his incredible power, Boros was both arrogant and prideful. Due to his love of battles and his inability to find an opponent who has been able to match him in power, he roamed the universe looking for worthy opponents that would be able to
                                stand against him. He was also extremely callous, indifferent to the destruction and loss of life his invasion caused to A-City, and the destruction of his ship and the death of most of his crew while fighting Saitama.

                                In the early ’70s, anime was still gaining a foothold as a legitimate and profitable form of entertainment. It was still largely seen as a vehicle for either dramatic stories, or children's tales, but Lupin brought adult comedy anime into the forefront.
                                Although his adult-oriented themes took a while to catch on, eventually his lecherous antics and suave handling of epic heists brought grown-ups firmly into anime and proved to Japanese studio execs that this kind of title
                                could make them money. From Rome, to Paris, to Rio, Lupin traveled far and wide in search of booty… both kinds. It was Lupin's love of women and his dirty mind that provided much of the comedy in the series, and it was
                                the first time racy humor found itself in popular anime.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the most beautiful part of the anime version of Lupin is that he's much more chivalrous than his manga counterpart. The anime version of the character was much more appropriate for the times and fir his role as a leading man of anime.

                                Temari is one of the main supporting characters in the Naruto anime and manga series and the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime and manga series. She is a jōnin-level kunoichi of Sunagakure and one of the three Sand Siblings. Temari is the eldest child
                                and only daughter of the Fourth Kazekage, and the older sister of Kankuro and Gaara.

                                Temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not being afraid to speak her mind. One of the few things shown to intimidate her is her younger brother Gaara. She very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding attitude,
                                when around the boy, due to the fear of Gaara's wrath. Temari does have a caring side, and is not above showing concern for others. She is often seen with Shikamaru. Temari is a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's
                                strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins. For actual combat she uses her giant iron fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide upon in order to intimidate her foes. Sometime after
                                The Fourth Shinobi War, Temari marries Shikamaru Nara and gave birth their first and only son, Shikadai. She is voiced by Romi Park in the Japanese version of the anime who also voiced Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist,
                                Tōshirō Hitsugaya, from Bleach. and by Tara Platt in the English version of the anime.

                                Team 10, a group of ninja consisting of himself, Choji Akimichi, Ino Yamanaka, and team leader Asuma Sarutobi. Shikamaru is portrayed as a lazy character, unwilling to apply his prodigious intelligence.

                                Shikamaru Nara is one of the smartest characters in the anime manga series Naruto. Masashi Kishimoto originally created Shikamaru in order for him to be the only winner of an early Naruto arc: the Chunin Exams, based on his high intelligence. However,
                                recommendations from his editors resulted in Kishimoto deciding to interrupt the fighting tournament between the ninjas in order to focus on a recently introduced villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless, Shikamaru ends up becoming
                                the only ninja from the original test to achieve a higher rank during Part I of the series.

                                Trunks has either blue[8][9][10] or lavender hair color and his mother's blue eyes. He has his father's eye shape, facial features and tanned skin. Several characters, such as Goku, Krillin and Bulma, remark how much Trunks resembles Vegeta. For the majority
                                of the Buu Saga, Present Trunks wears a dark green gi, an orange belt, orange wristbands and the same golden boots that Future Trunks wears, he also wears this in the movie, Bio-Broly. In the events of Broly - Second Coming,
                                Trunks wears a light green long sleeve hoodie with a black short sleeve undershirt with a red collar, indigo blue denim shorts and his golden boots from his primary outfit.

                                Trunks is born in November of Age 766 to Vegeta and Bulma, thus making him a Saiyan and Human hybrid, like Gohan. He was an illegitimate child due to the fact that he was conceived as a result of a brief affair between his parents. In his infancy, he
                                was well-loved and doted on by his mother, but it appeared as if his father had little to no parental emotions towards the boy due to the former never wanting to have children and viewing hybrids as a disgrace. However,
                                after the end of the Cell Games, the relationship between his parents improved and they got married, and they began raising Trunks as a family.

                                often going solo to root out the truth behind the cases she's working.

                                Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth
                                Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).

                                by two Iwagakure Jonin. Obito wanted to rescue his teammate; But Kakashi said that the mission came first. Kakashi found himself in the same situation as his father had been in the past and did not want to make the mistakes
                                that his father had. Obito disagreed and left Kakashi not before telling him that what his father did in the past made him a hero not a disgrace.

                                Ever the reluctant fighter, Vash was a living contradiction. He's gifted with superhuman fighting abilities, but also a superhuman capacity for compassion and kindness. He's a character who suffered countless scars and wounds to his own body to protect
                                others, even the very villains he was trying to stop, and his vow to never take a life provides plenty of drama in Trigun as his enemies use his virtue against him.

                                Vash is called "the humanoid typhoon" because utter destruction tends to follow him wherever he goes, and there's a huge bounty on his head. But in reality, he's humanity's secret guardian angel on the distant, wild planet of Gunsmoke. As a "Plant," he's
                                a being with power that few can comprehend. He's the greatest gunman on the planet, and all the criminals he faces don't stand a chance against him. But Vash's true challenge is in saving the world from his "brother" Knives,
                                and it's this conflict that brings out Vash's real heroism. The tale of Vash's childhood and his mother figure Rem is a great story, as is the story of how Knives ended up being the polar opposite of Vash. Although Vash
                                is often portrayed as a childish goofball, in reality he's a very complex and tortured character who is doing his best to save people who never even know what he's done for them.

                                death, Nagato adopted the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein) and, along with Konan, began leading a new Akatsuki — one that would force the world into peace using any means necessary.

                                Nagato lived with his parents: Fusō and Ise on the outskirts of Amegakure. When he was very young, Madara Uchiha secretly transplanted his Rinnegan into Nagato without his or his parents' knowledge.[8] Sometime later, during the Second Shinobi World War,
                                Nagato and his parents took shelter in their home to avoid the fighting going on around them.

                                Sōma Yukihira (幸ゆき平ひら 創そう真ま, Yukihira Sōma?) is the main protagonist of Shokugeki no Soma. He is the son of Jōichirō Yukihira and Tamako Yukihira, the proud owner of Restaurant Yukihira. He is a 92nd Tōtsuki Generation alumnus and a former resident of
                                Polar Star Dormitory. He is also a previous 1st seat of the Elite Ten Council

                                Sōma's main outfit is his Restaurant Yukihira cooking uniform, consisting of a black shirt with the restaurant's logo on the back and left chest area of his shirt. Whenever he cooks, he wears a white apron over his waist. While at Tōtsuki, Sōma wears
                                a black coat summer school uniform over his Yukihira cooking uniform. Sōma also ties his trademark white headband around his forehead whenever he cooks. If he is not cooking or bathing, he wears his headband around his
                                left wrist. Compared to his fellow Tōtsuki students, Sōma dresses very casually; in his free time, he sports a hanten jacket with a simple white shirt beneath it and a striped track pants at his places of residence. Sōma
                                states that dressing in his hanten calms him down.

                                Schneizel el Britannia (シュナイゼル・エル・ブリタニア, Shunaizeru eru Buritania) is 27 years old (28 at R2) and the Second Prince of the Britannian Imperial Family, as well as the Prime Minister of the Holy Britannian Empire. He is a strategist on par with Lelouch,
                                and the only person Lelouch was unable to beat in chess as a child.Charismatic and manipulative, cunning and ruthless, Schneizel is widely regarded as Lelouch's greatest adversary, including Lelouch himself, and the Prime
                                Minister serves as one of the primary antagonists of the series, particularly in Season 2, where he becomes the series' final antagonist.

                                Schneizel is charismatic and calculating, able to form complex strategies that can match even Lelouch's. Despite this, he shows a caring side to his subordinates, earning their respect and loyalty. His hierarchy in the Britannian family gives him great
                                power and influence; though he does have ambitions for the throne, a fact the Emperor seems aware of but not concerned by.

                                to respect his father and duties. Regardless, he vows to instead become a shinobi like his mentor.

                                Akane Tsunemori from Psycho Pass is one of the industry’s greatest female characters. And anime characters in general. She puts a lot of protagonist to shame for how well she’s written, and there’s no fan service or cliches to make it possible.

                                Just pure skill and focus. Akane isn’t an aggressive type, but she is persistent in her ideals and ideas. And isn’t afraid to share them, even in the face of “authority”.

                                Shota Aizawa (相あい澤ざわ消しょう太た Aizawa Shōta?), also known as the Erasure Hero: Eraser Head (イレイザー・ヘッド Ireizā Heddo?), is a Pro Hero and the homeroom teacher of U.A. High School's Class 1-A.Shota is a slender and tall, pale-skinned man with messy, shoulder-length
                                black hair, that partially hangs in front of his face and half-opened black eyes. He is usually recognized for his worn-out appearance,[1][2] often looking fatigued. His facial hair is almost always in a stubbly, unkempt
                                state (unless he needs to look good for the press), and his eyes tired and flat, unless he's in combat.

                                Shota is a very stern and reserved man who has lofty expectations of his students. He is primarily motivated by logic and does not believe in the necessity to maintain a clean-cut appearance or filter his words or ideas for others. He often comes off
                                as cold, apathetic, and impatient, exerting very little energy in most situations, preferring to take naps in his sleeping bag instead.Shota has proven to be very vocal and unafraid when expressing his ideas. He has mentioned
                                on several occasions that some of U.A.'s choices when it comes to examinations are not practical or challenging enough for real Hero hopefuls and is adamant about having certain systems used by the institution changed.[10]
                                He also blatantly stated that he did not believe Izuku Midoriya could become a hero when they first met.[3] He is also known for lying to his students in order to manipulate them into giving their best, a technique he describes
                                as a 'logical ruse'/'rational deception'.

                                Pikachu is widely considered to be the most popular and well-known Pokémon species, largely due to its appearance in the Pokémon anime television series as the companion of protagonist Ash Ketchum. In most vocalized appearances Pikachu is voiced by Ikue
                                Ōtani, though it has been portrayed by other actors, notably Ryan Reynolds in the live-action animated film Pokémon Detective Pikachu. Pikachu has been well received by critics, with particular praise given for its cuteness,
                                and has come to be regarded as an icon of Japanese pop culture.

                                Rimuru is an eccentric and childish person by nature but this shouldn't be mistaken for immaturity and naivety. Underneath the surface Rimuru is constantly analyzing, planning, and weighing the pros and cons of his actions, taking the smart move in the
                                long-term over more rash and emotional decisions. In stark contrast to this normally composed and calculative demeanor, he's absolutely ruthless when it comes to handling people who have angered him. He'll go as far as
                                brutal torture and murder without batting an eye if he can get away with it and uses more subtle methods like intimidation and blackmail when he can't. Rimuru also takes a great deal of care with his personal image, lying
                                on official accounts, erasing memories, and creating forged historical documents to make him come off as a more kind and benevolent person than he actually is in reality. Despite his often selfish and nefarious tendencies,
                                Rimuru does deeply care for his subordinates, viewing them as something like a family or collection of children. And thanks to the memories of Satoru Mikami and Shizue Izawa Rimuru has access to a robust set of human ethics
                                to rely on when his more cruel monster self isn't up to the task. His goal in life is to create a convenient world where he can kick back and lazily enjoy entertainment similar in quality to what is found on Earth.

                                Anos Voldigoad (アノス・ヴォルディゴード Anosu Vorudigōdo?) is a powerful demon who was infamously known during the Mythical Age as the Demon King of Tyranny (暴虐の魔王 Bōgyaku no Maō?), for his immense power and cruelty towards his enemies. After giving up his life
                                to separate the world into four, he reincarnated into the Magical Age and began attending the Demon King Academy, only to be branded as a misfit. He is the titular protagonist of the The Misfit of Demon King Academy.

                                Anos is the reincarnation of the man who was feared as the Demon King of Tyranny two thousand years ago. He is resolute, stalwart, and invincible. His absolute power instils a veritable self-confidence that is only surpassed by his ego. Because of his
                                overwhelming prowess, Anos possesses an easygoing attitude and an unrivaled sense of perseverance when facing any challenge that may come his way. Despite being called the Demon King of Tyranny, Anos has a definitive moral
                                compass and generally has a kind and caring outlook. He takes a great interest in the well-being of not only his family, but also his friends and followers, and is quick to reward them for their loyalty. He is willing to
                                go through great lengths to assist in their development, in order for them to reach their full potential. Other people may see him as cruel, but his personal creed is not to kill people needlessly. Even if he would never
                                admit it, Anos is very protective of his fellow friends and followers. While Anos is not inherently evil, his chaotic and sometimes ruthless methods when dealing with his enemies, earned him his title. While he originally
                                never proclaimed himself as the Demon King, he has openly embraced it as the rest of the world views him as such. Those who oppose him, fear his power, and are threatened by the mere fact that a single man possesses such
                                power. The legends of his gaze striking fear into those who appear before him are not just a rumor either. Just using his Magic Eyes to control others' actions is enough for some to go mentally insane.

                                Shōyō Hinata is the main protagonist of the Haikyū!! series by Haruichi Furudate. Shoyo is a high school student who wishes to become like the "Small Giant," a former Karasuno High School student and volleyball club member. To achieve his dream, he decides
                                to join Karasuno, but to join the volleyball team he and Tobio Kageyama, his old opponent in a volleyball match, must overcome their rivalry and work together. For the majority of the series, Hinata was a first-year student
                                at Karasuno High and one of the volleyball team's middle blockers. Hinata has a cheerful and energetic personality. Hinata has an unusually high ability to jump. Since he was young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate
                                for his lack of height.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He is easily excited and can be quite loud. For the most part, Hinata is very simple-minded which sometimes causes him to make rash decisions. However, he is also shown to be quite observant. He is capable of reading social cues and can be incredibly
                                empathetic toward others' struggles. As such, he often says just what others need to hear to push themselves in the right direction. His friendly and straightforward personality allows him to befriend even the quietest
                                of people effortlessly, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High. Despite his easy-going personality, Hinata is extremely competitive, especially when it comes to volleyball. Hinata has a very big fortitude
                                to win and thus, doesn't give up easily during a match no matter if it's a practice match or a real match. Hinata can also exhibit a very scary and intimidating face when people underestimate him.

                                In Demon Slayer, Doma or Douma is the Upper-Rank Two Demon, holding a prominent position among Twelve Kizuki. In the manga, Doma is described as a tall and muscular man with a pale complexion, and he made his debut in Chapter 96. Honestly, Doma is one
                                of the most complicated demons in the manga.

                                On one side, Doma has a friendly side and charismatic personality, and on the other hand, he has an extremely dark side. For instance, Doma always prefers to eat young women. In fact, Doma met Daki and Gyutaro while consuming a woman. Doma then turned
                                the siblings into demons, as was revealed in the episode. However, at the time when Doma met Daki and Gyutaro, he was Upper-Rank Six. Over time, Doma grew in strength by consuming humans and became Upper-Rank Two.

                                Veldora Tempest (ヴェルドラ゠テンペスト Verudora Tenpesuto?), also known as Storm Dragon Veldora (暴風竜ヴェルドラ Bōfūryū Verudora?) is one of five True Dragons.</p>
                            <p>
                                Veldora is generally boisterous, excitable, but also fairly easy going. Despite his reputation as someone who just wants to rampage, Veldora is largely only dangerous if he doesn't get to unwind once in a while or if his loved ones are threatened. He
                                is also quite energetic, prideful, and has no reservation in showing off his strength. After meeting Rimuru and reading the manga stored in Rimuru's memories, which he refers to as "sacred texts", he began to reconsider
                                some of his more destructive previous behavior. His time spent in Rimuru's stomach with Ifrit and his time spent living in Tempest resulted in Veldora developing a somewhat more patient, analytical, and less impulsive personality.
                                Despite his nonchalant personality, he greatly appreciates Rimuru as his sworn friend and trusts him. Veldora is not good at facing his older sister Velzard, so he avoids contact with her as much as possible. In his mind,
                                Veldora was the baby of his family. He believed that his sisters were only there to torture him. As such, he views Rimuru as his friend and brother figure in that he not only understands Rimuru but also tries to serve as
                                a sort of mentor.

                                Kanon (カノン Kanon?), commonly known as Hero Kanon (勇者カノン Yūsha Kanon?), was the legendary human hero who fought against the Demon King Anos during the Great War that occurred 2,000 years ago. Kanon was famous for having seven sources that made him nigh-immortal,
                                as well as being the wielder of the legendary holy sword, the Spirit God Human Sword Evansmana.</p>
                            <p>
                                Kanon was a kind and courageous person, as he was noted to have the qualities of a true hero, that many looked up to such as his willingness to fight and die for those who could not fight for themselves, as Kanon was stated to have great charisma that
                                rallied people to him and allowed him to give hope to them. Kanon was sensitive to the hearts of others and very perceptive about the feelings of others, as he could see what people were trying to hide behind their outwards
                                appearances. It is noted that he had great willpower, as he was able to continue battling against Anos and continuously having his sources destroyed, despite the agonizing pain it would cause him. Kanon strived for peace
                                and was compassionate to even his enemies, often letting demons go if he didn't have a reason to kill them. Even after all the hardships that he went through because of Anos during the Great War, Kanon was able to trust
                                in him and his proposal for a peaceful world. After being killed by Jerga's allies, Kanon decided to work alongside demons instead, who were more willing to forgive and forget. As revealed by Lay's deeper and hidden feelings,
                                Kanon was in truth suffocated by the duties of being a hero. As a country boy, all he ever wanted to do was to swing the sword. He was never strong nor righteous, he was afraid of death and never even wanted to kill. But
                                more people had died by his hands than the people he managed to save. But even so, someone had to bring back hope to the people, even at the expense of themselves. As he kept dying and reviving, over and over again, he
                                one day realized that the people had the Hero Kanon, so who did he have? Then one day someone reached out their hands to him, the very person he was supposed to kill, the Demon King of Tyranny Anos Voldigoad, his "only
                                hero".

                                revenge is a recurring storyline present throughout many episodes. Although Hattori is a good friend, Kenichi sometimes fights with him due to misunderstandings created by Kemumaki. Sometimes Jippou, Togejirou and Tsubame

                                who travel to his doorstep. He is also the originator of the Kamehameha Wave. Despite his lecherous tendencies and his old age, Roshi is an extremely respected and capable warrior, serving as the master of Gohan, Ox-King,
                                Goku, Krillin, and Yamcha. His drive to push his students to new heights and support them on their martial arts journeys makes him one of the most notable supporting characters in the series.

                                Within the series, he is an elderly martial arts master, born on March 20th, who is the innovator of the Kamehameha (カメハメ波) technique. His students include Grandpa Son Gohan, The Ox-King, Son Goku, Krillin and Yamcha. He is bald, sports a thick van dyke
                                beard, and wears sunglasses, beach clothes, or martial arts suits. He usually wields a walking stick and, in early appearances, wears a turtle's shell on his back. In spite of his lechery, cantankerousness and occasional
                                whimsy or foolishness, he is often depicted as wise and perceptive. While a popular character with Dragon Ball fans, the depiction of some of his antics has been met with criticism or deemed highly controversial.
