                                <p class="card-text">Naruto Uzumaki is the main protagonist in the popular manga and
                                    anime series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                                    strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of
                                    Konoha (or Leaf Village).</p>
                                <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's
                                    chakra, which is much greater than
                                    the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely
                                    grant Naruto his power unless they
                                    were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the
                                    fox by his name, Kurama. At this
                                    point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                                    down and kill demons, and later swore to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji, the King of Demons,
                                    in order to prevent others from suffering the same fate as him.

                                    Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan.
                                    He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju,
                                    with the intention of beginning an era of peace.

                                    When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of

                                    Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to
                                    Obito shortly before his actual death.

                                    Lelouch was one of the best examples of a hero gone astray. As often happens in
                                    dramatic stories, his good intentions paved a road to a dark place.
                                    His rise and downfall is almost Shakespearean in nature, as his own pride and
                                    arrogance cloud his judgment and he misses out on what was truly important.
                                    But at least he did it all with a sense of dramatic flair! His alter ego Zero,
                                    complete with mysterious helmet and flowing cape, was an iconic tool to secure a
                                    place in the psyche of both his enemies and his followers.
                                    In the end, Lelouch's plans are successful, though not in the way anyone ever
                                    expected.

                                    After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission
                                    in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a
                                    ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki,
                                    Sasuke starts developing his skills.

                                    that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from
                                    others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the
                                    truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth
                                    Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to
                                    Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants,
                                    becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage".

                                    In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara, but the events of the
                                    war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create
                                    an ideal world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ, Tobi) and Madara Uchiha
                                    himself, Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance
                                    his machinations, eventually going public and starting the Fourth Shinobi World War.

                                    Sakura Uchiha (うちはサクラ, Uchiha Sakura, née Haruno (春野)) is a kunoichi of
                                    Konohagakure. When assigned to Team 7, Sakura quickly finds herself ill-prepared for
                                    the duties of a shinobi.
                                    However, after training under the Sannin Tsunade, she overcomes this, and becomes
                                    recognised as one of the greatest medical-nin in the world.

                                    As a child, Sakura was insecure and highly self-conscious about her large forehead,
                                    covering it with her bangs. It was not until she met Ino, who defended her from
                                    bullies and became her friend, that she become more self-confident.

                                    Rock Lee (ロック・リー, Rokku Rī) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Lee clan and a member of
                                    Team Guy. Unlike most shinobi, he lacked the skills necessary to use ninjutsu or
                                    genjutsu. However, he overcomes those shortcomings by undergoing special training
                                    from Might Guy that would make him a taijutsu master while still a genin.

                                    Under Guy's leadership, Lee has acquired a number of his sensei's personality
                                    traits: he is energetic, optimistic, and hot-blooded, and shows the epitome of a
                                    "nice guy". He believes that one cannot dislike food and shows strong dedication to
                                    his promises; when this promise is broken, just barely, he assigns himself arduous
                                    training to prevent it from happening again.

                                    than Tokyo Ghoul's Ken Kaneki. The one-eyed ghoul's story is truly a tragedy, but
                                    fans admire him for several reasons. Many consider Kaneki one of the best anime
                                    protagonists of all time.</p>

                                <p>Ken Kaneki is a man of many layers, and just as many flaws. Kaneki's journey in Tokyo
                                    Ghoul is one of suffering, pain, and a gruesome, nightmarish reality. The series
                                    depicts a constant tug-of-war between Kaneki's ghoul side fighting against his
                                    humanity..</p>
