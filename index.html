                            <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's chakra, which is much greater than the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant Naruto his power
                                unless they were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by his name, Kurama. At this point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.

                                Matsuda's police skills are lacking in experience, and at times, particularly in the beginning of the series, he somewhat impedes the investigation process. Much to the irritation of his peers, his brash attitude can get him into tricky situations, as evidenced by the time he infiltrated Yotsuba and had to fake his own death to get out.[2] Members of the Task Force, such as Ryuzaki and Shuichi Aizawa, seem to view him as a reckless, naive young detective lacking seriousness for his work.

                                Takemichi Hanagaki is the main protagonist of the 2017 Japanese manga series Tokyo Revengers<br> and its 2021 anime adaptation. He is a young man who can travel back in time: a time leaper. In order to save his girlfriend

                                Takemichi Hanagaki is an individual who’s lost the sense of direction, and that’s why he’s got low self-esteem. He apologizes for the smallest things and cries easily. He’s called a “crybaby hero” by his best friend Akkun.<br>                                As he’s not very financially stable, he badmouths the rich people. He’s the best version of a weak crybaby who’s empathetic and kind beyond his years and never gives up.

                                that he acquired as a result of his fight with the League of Villains. He has three piercings in his left ear. He usually has his mouth covered by a plague doctor mask. Following his battle with Izuku, however, his mask
                                is removed and his mouth is consequently uncovered. Following his defeat, he also lost both of his arms to Mr. Compress and Tomura Shigaraki during his escort to a villain hospital.

                                Kai wears a black dress shirt with matching dress pants, a pale gray tie around his neck and a belt with a long, thin buckle around his waist, with three beaded lobe piercings in his left ear. Over this, he wears a dark olive-green bomber jacket with
                                a thick purple fur collar and white lace-up sneakers with tan soles and no socks. The white surgical gloves he wears on his hands and the magenta plague mask he wears over his mouth, which is tipped and embroidered with
                                gold, are his most distinguishing features.

                                Minoru can be very hypocritical, criticizing others for perceived perverted behavior, even if they turn out to be nothing more than misunderstandings. Minoru is one who always speaks his mind, even when it comes off as harsh and insulting due to his comments
                                being more on the cynical side. He also has a more teasing and goading side, even when he's not being perverted, and has a habit of jeering at others for the fun of it. He is not a bully however, and does express fear and
                                concern for when others have been hurt or are in danger.

                                In the early ’70s, anime was still gaining a foothold as a legitimate and profitable
                                form of entertainment. It was still largely seen as a vehicle for either dramatic
                                stories, or children's tales, but Lupin brought adult comedy anime into the forefront.
                                Although his adult-oriented themes took a while to catch on, eventually his lecherous
                                antics and suave handling of epic heists brought grown-ups firmly into anime and proved
                                to Japanese studio execs that this kind of title
                                could make them money. From Rome, to Paris, to Rio, Lupin traveled far and wide in
                                search of booty… both kinds. It was Lupin's love of women and his dirty mind that
                                provided much of the comedy in the series, and it was
                                the first time racy humor found itself in popular anime.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the most beautiful part of the anime version of Lupin is that he's much more
                                chivalrous than his manga counterpart. The anime version of the character was much more
                                appropriate for the times and fir his role as a leading man of anime.

                                and emotions through his songs. He is very diligent when it comes to his band and is
                                paying attention even if it does not come across as such.
                                Mafuyu shows that he is very straightforward in his style of speech
                                and tends to take certain things literally. Despite his naive and spaced out demeanour,
                                he shows to be very sharp and observant about things that happen around him and also
                                sensitive to other people‘s emotions. Sometimes Mafuyu can be sarcastic and quite
                                aggressive.

                                Where would Gintama be without Shinpachi? The Yorozuya likely wouldn't
                                be able to function at all, either as an odd-jobs business or as a meta
                                purveyor of comedy. Shinpachi is the one who makes sure they stick to a
                                schedule and complete tasks, and he even manages to keep Gintoki and
                                Kagura from committing too many arrestable offenses. As the most serious
                                and logical person in the trio, he makes the other two seem far more absurd,
                                which adds an extra layer of humor to the show.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But Shinpachi isn't without his own bizarre foibles
                                . If you get him talking about his idol obsession,
                                he seems every bit as ridiculous as Kagura when she's
                                eating her weight in pickled seaweed or fighting her
                                giant dog. Still, when it comes to helping the other
                                members of the Yorozuya defeat an enemy or solve a
                                serious problem, he can always be counted on.

                                Soma Schicksal is a character introduced in God Eater Burst. He is a God Eater veteran
                                at the age of only 18 and a member of the 1st Unit.
                                Son of Johannes von Schicksal and Aisha Gauche. In God Eater 2, he joined the traveling
                                branch Cradle along with Alisa, Lindow, and the Protagonist. Soma is the main character
                                in God Eater Prologue.

                                Soma is introduced during an early mission in God Eater Resurrection. He is aloof and
                                lonely, and many God Eaters try to avoid him due to the high number of casualties that
                                seem to take place near him.
                                True to the rumors, during the Protagonist's first mission with him, Eric der Vogelweid
                                is brutally killed by an Ogretail.

                                Shōko is also hard to anger and slow to cry, as she has endured a long, painful life;
                                with her mother aside leaving her grandmother to take care of the Nishimiya sisters.
                                her hearing loss is drastic enough to the point that she can be considered clinically
                                deaf.

                                Kento Nanami (七なな海み建けん人と Nanami Kento) is a supporting character in Jujutsu Kaisen.

                                and Suguru Geto. Nanami initially left Jujutsu High after graduating to become a

                                simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly
                                obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him.
                                She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise
                                that either endangers Yukki's life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts
                                turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able
                                to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts
                                thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without
                                ever losing her nerves.

					Killua near at the beginning of the story mistake Leorio for an old man, but he is

					Leorio is initially introduced as a very selfish narcissist who places great emphasis on material 
					wealth. Despite his assertions that he is only after money, he eventually reveals to Kurapika that
					his dream is to one day become a doctor in order to help the poor. He believes that all things in 
					the world (lives, dreams, etc.) can be bought and that becoming a Hunter will provide him with the 
					necessary funds for his medical education. Due to his first spat with Kurapika, as well as the test 
					on the way to the navigator's cabin, it seems that he has a sensitivity for those who do not take 
					him seriously or treat him with disrespect. His real priorities seem to be friends first, then his 
					dream of becoming a great doctor, with everything else afterward.</p>

                                She barely talks to other students in her school and exhibits a desire to be left alone

                                she summons Archer for her Servant, although she originally wanted to summon Saber.
                                Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father
                                Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests..

                                Two centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and
                                Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars.
                                The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all
                                Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka;
                                at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and
                                future wars.
                                Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch;
                                these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's
                                Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail
                                Wars, free from harassment by either organization.

                                Funimation and LUK Internacional dubs, is a white (Shiro means white) pup Shin-chan
                                found in a cardboard box in episode 7b (I found a Puppy). While he is a beloved member
                                of the family, he is the subject of neglect thanks to his owner's forgetfulness and
                                short attention-span. He is a very intelligent dog, often presenting logic and intellect
                                that surpasses his human owners. As his meals from the Noharas are at best inconsistent
                                and at worst far-in-between, he has developed a venerable talent for foraging and
                                scavenging to survive days without meals. An oddly human-like dog, he is very
                                responsible and painstakingly careful. He saves the world under the superhero moniker of
                                Super Shiro

                                He is very beloved to Shin-chan, but Shin-chan often teases, mocks and forgets him. His
                                doghouse also often ends up becoming a place for Shin-chan to hide himself or something
                                he doesn't want his family to find. Shiro often plays protector to Himawari, more often
                                than not sacrificing his well-being in the process. In SPECIAL 53 it is discovered that
                                Shiro and Shin-chan are born in the same year, which means that they are both 5 years
                                old

                                Konan is a supporting character in the manga and anime Naruto. She was the only kunoichi

                                name. She became the leader of Amegakure after defecting from Akatsuki.

                                She is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka in the Japanese version of the anime, and by Dorothy

                            <p>Konan was a stoic, calm, and level-headed woman (much like her partner, Nagato).

                                During her childhood, she was a bright, compassionate and relatively cheerful little
                                girl, in comparison to Yahiko's tough attitude and Nagato's sensitivity. However, the
                                traumatic events since then have led her to become very serious, and she never spoke
                                during Akatsuki meetings. Nevertheless, she has always placed the safety of her
                                team-mates above her own.

                                Blast (ブラスト, Burasuto) is the S-Class Rank 1 professional hero of the Hero Association. Outside of Saitama, he is the Hero Association's most powerful hero. He currently appears to be going to various places in order to collect the Mysterious Cubes, which is a hobby of his. Only a few select Hero Association staff members have the means to communicate with him. Blast does not disclose his personal information in the Hero Association Catalog. However, like Saitama, he considers his hero work a hobby. He also seems to have independent tendencies, keeping his location and status unknown and advising Tatsumaki to use her powers to defend herself rather than expecting others to save her. Blast holds the title of Class-Rank 1 hero of the Hero Association, earning him the distinction of being the strongest, most powerful hero in the association. Blast was presented to fans as a member of a legendary group of guardians. These legends are tasked with locating the cubes of multiple Gods all throughout world. The goal is to keep people from getting near these cubes, because if they are, they will become Mysterious Beings. Beyond this, Blast has also had some legendary battles in his day. During one such legendary battle he came up against Centichoro, a giant and one of the strongest centipedes in existence.

                            <p class="card-text ">Holo is a wolf harvest deity originally from a land in the north known
                                as Yoitsu.
                                She made a promise with men from a town called Pasloe where she would ensure the town
                                would have good wheat harvests year after year.
                                However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not
                                rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes
                                from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world
                                has changed since she has been in Pasloe.
                                Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her
                                large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears.
                                Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared. </p>
                            <p>She refers to herself as the "Wise Wolf of Yoitsu " (ヨイツの賢狼).
                                She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for
                                hundreds of years in Pasloe,
                                she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She
                                relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness,
                                which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own
                                way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have,
                                as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is quite scared of that
                                fact, but hides it with jokes. She has a peculiar way of speaking, modeled after that of
                                the oiran high-class courtesans.
                                She is fond of delicious food and alcohol,
                                but especially loves apples. She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it,
                                constantly combing and maintaining it.

                                His intelligence always gets him perfect scores on his tests, and he easily aces any
                                sports he played.
                                Although, his favorites are astronomy and philosophy, Dekisugi excels at any subject.
                                Thus, it's not rare for him to receive calls from his friends, asking for guidance or
                                tips.

                                Dekisugi is highly esteemed by the people around him.
                                His good behavior and academic plus athletic excellence, earns him the title of "honor student " from the teachers.
                                A wide range of skills plus his good looks have charmed a lot of girls in his class, and
                                one of them is Shizuka.
                                This seemingly "perfect " image of a prince makes him to be the subject of envy of his
                                classmates, especially Nobita.

                                Gian sometimes serves as the primary antagonist in some Manga chapters
                                and anime episodes when he is bad or evil in the franchise.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He is recognized by his large build (might partly be contributed by obesity) as well as
                                his mean and aggressive behavior.
                                He "rules " the neighborhood with force, often at the physical expense of other children,
                                especially Nobita, who often resorts to asking Doraemon for gadgets to get even on him.
                                He appears to be just as dependent on Nobita as Nobita is on Doraemon as he constantly
                                tells him what to do despite Nobita's protests. In addition, he has a tendency to steal
                                or rob others,
                                usually Suneo, who offers to be Gian's sidekick on most occasions.

                            blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of his neck. While working, Satoru wears a dark blue
                            zip-up jacket with a high collar that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit matching black pants and black dress boots.

                            depends on the player's decisions; she becomes a love interest to Shirou in the novel's first route and also serves as that route's servant protagonist, a supporting character in the second, and a villain called "Saber Alter"
                            (セイバー・オルタ, Seibā Oruta) in the third route.

                            of Shirou's guardian Kiritsugu Emiya during the previous Holy Grail War, and in the sequel Fate/hollow ataraxia. Saber also appears in the novel's printed and animated adaptations, reprising her role in the game.

                            Akuto has an incredible amount of power within him that sometimes gets out of control. Akuto has a highly serious personality but not without some humor. In the manga, he has much more of a temper, and, in a fight, is unwilling to hold anything back.
                            In the anime, he tries to restrain himself in order to convince everyone that he has no desire to be the Demon King. Powers: Akuto is capable of controlling and manipulating "mana", a magical energy that resides in the bodies
                            of living things and in surroundings. For instance, he is able to absorb the mana of a large demon dog, thus transforming it back into a normal puppy, a feat that has never been performed before. However, his immense power
                            is also highly volatile and most of his early attempts at controlling mana and creating magical projectiles, no matter how benign they are supposed to be, resulted in catastrophic explosions. His name is phonetically very similar
                            to a Japanese phrase meaning "Great/Ultimate villain".

                            Lelouch was one of the best examples of a hero gone astray. As often happens in dramatic stories, his good intentions paved a road to a dark place. His rise and downfall is almost Shakespearean in nature, as his own pride and arrogance cloud his judgment
                            and he misses out on what was truly important. But at least he did it all with a sense of dramatic flair! His alter ego Zero, complete with mysterious helmet and flowing cape, was an iconic tool to secure a place in the psyche
                            of both his enemies and his followers. In the end, Lelouch's plans are successful, though not in the way anyone ever expected.

                            when this promise is broken, just barely, he assigns himself arduous training to prevent it from happening again.

                            games. Nevertheless, the character also received negative criticism.

                            having become so powerful that no battle thrilled him. His intergalactic travels in search of a worthy opponent led him to Earth, where he was killed by Saitama.[4]

                            stand against him. He was also extremely callous, indifferent to the destruction and loss of life his invasion caused to A-City, and the destruction of his ship and the death of most of his crew while fighting Saitama.

                            In the early ’70s, anime was still gaining a foothold as a legitimate and profitable form of entertainment. It was still largely seen as a vehicle for either dramatic stories, or children's tales, but Lupin brought adult comedy anime into the forefront.
                            Although his adult-oriented themes took a while to catch on, eventually his lecherous antics and suave handling of epic heists brought grown-ups firmly into anime and proved to Japanese studio execs that this kind of title
                            could make them money. From Rome, to Paris, to Rio, Lupin traveled far and wide in search of booty… both kinds. It was Lupin's love of women and his dirty mind that provided much of the comedy in the series, and it was the
                            first time racy humor found itself in popular anime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the most beautiful part of the anime version of Lupin is that he's much more chivalrous than his manga counterpart. The anime version of the character was much more appropriate for the times and fir his role as a leading man of anime.

                            Temari is one of the main supporting characters in the Naruto anime and manga series and the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime and manga series. She is a jōnin-level kunoichi of Sunagakure and one of the three Sand Siblings. Temari is the eldest child
                            and only daughter of the Fourth Kazekage, and the older sister of Kankuro and Gaara.

                            Temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not being afraid to speak her mind. One of the few things shown to intimidate her is her younger brother Gaara. She very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding attitude,
                            when around the boy, due to the fear of Gaara's wrath. Temari does have a caring side, and is not above showing concern for others. She is often seen with Shikamaru. Temari is a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's
                            strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins. For actual combat she uses her giant iron fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide upon in order to intimidate her foes. Sometime after
                            The Fourth Shinobi War, Temari marries Shikamaru Nara and gave birth their first and only son, Shikadai. She is voiced by Romi Park in the Japanese version of the anime who also voiced Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist,
                            Tōshirō Hitsugaya, from Bleach. and by Tara Platt in the English version of the anime.

                            and the fact that she doesn't need to consume human blood to survive.

                            The arch-nemesis of the Joestar family and the first of two JoJo's entries onto our list, Dio Brando is a delectably detestable villain. Raised by an abusive father, at an early age Dio dedicated himself to destroying the Joestar family after being taken
                            in as an orphan. From tormenting the family to torturing their pets, Dio's evil only grew once he found the Stone Mask, a relic which turned those who wore it into vampires -- a fate he would later meet himself.

                        <p>
                            At one point Dio even used it to create an undead army of followers including diabolical figures like Jack the Ripper, showing just how evil he really was. One of anime's greatest antagonists, Dio also later became a Stand user, adding to his terrifying
                            and terrible powerset.

                            Shikamaru Nara (奈良 シカマル, Nara Shikamaru) is a fictional character in the manga and anime franchise, Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto. In the anime and manga, Shikamaru is a ninja affiliated with the village Hidden in the Leaves. He is a member of
                            Team 10, a group of ninja consisting of himself, Choji Akimichi, Ino Yamanaka, and team leader Asuma Sarutobi. Shikamaru is portrayed as a lazy character, unwilling to apply his prodigious intelligence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shikamaru Nara is one of the smartest characters in the anime manga series Naruto. Masashi Kishimoto originally created Shikamaru in order for him to be the only winner of an early Naruto arc: the Chunin Exams, based on his high intelligence. However,
                            recommendations from his editors resulted in Kishimoto deciding to interrupt the fighting tournament between the ninjas in order to focus on a recently introduced villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless, Shikamaru ends up becoming
                            the only ninja from the original test to achieve a higher rank during Part I of the series.

                            of the Buu Saga, Present Trunks wears a dark green gi, an orange belt, orange wristbands and the same golden boots that Future Trunks wears, he also wears this in the movie, Bio-Broly. In the events of Broly - Second Coming,
                            Trunks wears a light green long sleeve hoodie with a black short sleeve undershirt with a red collar, indigo blue denim shorts and his golden boots from his primary outfit.

                            Trunks is born in November of Age 766 to Vegeta and Bulma, thus making him a Saiyan and Human hybrid, like Gohan. He was an illegitimate child due to the fact that he was conceived as a result of a brief affair between his parents. In his infancy, he
                            was well-loved and doted on by his mother, but it appeared as if his father had little to no parental emotions towards the boy due to the former never wanting to have children and viewing hybrids as a disgrace. However, after
                            the end of the Cell Games, the relationship between his parents improved and they got married, and they began raising Trunks as a family.

                            Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage

                            by two Iwagakure Jonin. Obito wanted to rescue his teammate; But Kakashi said that the mission came first. Kakashi found himself in the same situation as his father had been in the past and did not want to make the mistakes
                            that his father had. Obito disagreed and left Kakashi not before telling him that what his father did in the past made him a hero not a disgrace.

                            short temper, isn't afraid to get into fights.

                            His abilities stem from being a Fullbringer along with having Shinigami blood in him as well. In a way, he is the best of both worlds as his unique skill set allows him to constantly be on an upward projection power-wise compared to the other Shinigami

                            Ever the reluctant fighter, Vash was a living contradiction. He's gifted with superhuman fighting abilities, but also a superhuman capacity for compassion and kindness. He's a character who suffered countless scars and wounds to his own body to protect
                            others, even the very villains he was trying to stop, and his vow to never take a life provides plenty of drama in Trigun as his enemies use his virtue against him.

                            Vash is called "the humanoid typhoon" because utter destruction tends to follow him wherever he goes, and there's a huge bounty on his head. But in reality, he's humanity's secret guardian angel on the distant, wild planet of Gunsmoke. As a "Plant," he's
                            a being with power that few can comprehend. He's the greatest gunman on the planet, and all the criminals he faces don't stand a chance against him. But Vash's true challenge is in saving the world from his "brother" Knives,
                            and it's this conflict that brings out Vash's real heroism. The tale of Vash's childhood and his mother figure Rem is a great story, as is the story of how Knives ended up being the polar opposite of Vash. Although Vash is
                            often portrayed as a childish goofball, in reality he's a very complex and tortured character who is doing his best to save people who never even know what he's done for them.

                            death, Nagato adopted the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein) and, along with Konan, began leading a new Akatsuki — one that would force the world into peace using any means necessary.

                            Nagato and his parents took shelter in their home to avoid the fighting going on around them.

                            by two men in black later revealed to be members of the Black Organization. The poison de-aged Shinichi's entire body except for his nervous system and therefore he still has the personality, memories, and incredible deductive

                            that dressing in his hanten calms him down.

                            Schneizel el Britannia (シュナイゼル・エル・ブリタニア, Shunaizeru eru Buritania) is 27 years old (28 at R2) and the Second Prince of the Britannian Imperial Family, as well as the Prime Minister of the Holy Britannian Empire. He is a strategist on par with Lelouch,
                            and the only person Lelouch was unable to beat in chess as a child.Charismatic and manipulative, cunning and ruthless, Schneizel is widely regarded as Lelouch's greatest adversary, including Lelouch himself, and the Prime Minister
                            serves as one of the primary antagonists of the series, particularly in Season 2, where he becomes the series' final antagonist.

                            Schneizel is charismatic and calculating, able to form complex strategies that can match even Lelouch's. Despite this, he shows a caring side to his subordinates, earning their respect and loyalty. His hierarchy in the Britannian family gives him great
                            power and influence; though he does have ambitions for the throne, a fact the Emperor seems aware of but not concerned by.

                            red-handed performing unethical experiments on his fellow citizens for the sake of this immortality, Orochimaru defected from Konoha rather than be persecuted for his ambitions, and for many years sought the village's destruction

                            act like a "doormat" and take what they want or desire. Her personality alternates between unselfish love, passive-aggressive revenge, and taught helplessness. Her past and present selves are tragic and spiteful. Anthy, like
                            Utena Tenjou, both defies and fits the preconceptions that she represents as both a princess and a witch.

                        <p>
                            Anime-only fans hate Akaza because he killed Rengoku during the Mugen Train arc. However, a single incident is not enough to entirely judge his character.

                            Shota Aizawa (相あい澤ざわ消しょう太た Aizawa Shōta?), also known as the Erasure Hero: Eraser Head (イレイザー・ヘッド Ireizā Heddo?), is a Pro Hero and the homeroom teacher of U.A. High School's Class 1-A.Shota is a slender and tall, pale-skinned man with messy, shoulder-length
                            black hair, that partially hangs in front of his face and half-opened black eyes. He is usually recognized for his worn-out appearance,[1][2] often looking fatigued. His facial hair is almost always in a stubbly, unkempt state
                            (unless he needs to look good for the press), and his eyes tired and flat, unless he's in combat.

                        <p>
                            Shota is a very stern and reserved man who has lofty expectations of his students. He is primarily motivated by logic and does not believe in the necessity to maintain a clean-cut appearance or filter his words or ideas for others. He often comes off
                            as cold, apathetic, and impatient, exerting very little energy in most situations, preferring to take naps in his sleeping bag instead.Shota has proven to be very vocal and unafraid when expressing his ideas. He has mentioned
                            on several occasions that some of U.A.'s choices when it comes to examinations are not practical or challenging enough for real Hero hopefuls and is adamant about having certain systems used by the institution changed.[10]
                            He also blatantly stated that he did not believe Izuku Midoriya could become a hero when they first met.[3] He is also known for lying to his students in order to manipulate them into giving their best, a technique he describes
                            as a 'logical ruse'/'rational deception'.

                            earthbending, and firebending.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He was also one of a select few Avatars and one of the first in many cycles[8] to learn the ancient art of energybending and the first Avatar known to have actively used the technique.

                            Agni is a kind, caring, and compassionate individual who works to the fullest of his capabilities to make others feel welcome, useful, and needed; he demonstrated this disposition when he identified the Phantomhive servants' strengths and assigned them
                            compatible tasks.[4] Furthermore, Agni is exceptionally humble and frequently dismisses praise.[5]

                            Additionally, Agni likes to cook, read, meditate, and pray. He dislikes the "turbulent mundane life."[8] When greatly distressed, he may cry tears of blood.[9]

                            For the longest time, while under the influence of the Weight Crab, Hitagi was a guarded person, appearing cold in order to hide away her oddity from the rest of the world, hiding herself beneath a shell of aggression and appearing unapproachable to the
                            rest of her schoolmates[1]. During this time, she pushed away anyone who tried to help her or get close to her, most notably her former friend Suruga Kanbaru[4]. This distrust in other people was born out of her inability to
                            shoulder any regret, lingering hatred or any other such burdens, due to her interaction with the Weight Crab[1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, as noted by Deishuu Kaiki, Hitagi is a person who refuses to let gods carry her burdens, instead wishing to shoulder that weight by herself, no matter how painful it may be[5], which leads to her eventual taking back of the weight that the Crab
                            severed from her. Her refusal to let sleeping dogs lie and desire to face her own past instead of just letting it go also manifests in her restoring her relationship with Suruga[4]. In Kaiki's words, Hitagi is a person who
                            always treats her current love as her first, showing her ability to move on and not be chained down by her past[5].

                            he loves her too. However, he is scared of some of Hattori's ninja techniques, and can easily be intimidated by him. Kemumaki comes from the Koga clan, and the Iga and Koga clan are sworn enemies. He does have a soft side though.
                            In his first appearance, it is revealed that he is a ninja.

                            revels in making them suffer. He also can be overbearing towards his cat Kagechiyo(Kiyo in English and Indian Dub).

                            her with a familiar tone, and tells Zenkichi not to make her cry anymore. Ajimu seems to exist in the hearts of both Zenkichi and Kumagawa. Each time Kumagawa dies, he encounters her in his heart before he can revive himself
                            with his All Fiction.[1] Because of this, he has come to regard her with extreme hatred.[2] On the other hand she has a rather strong affection for Zenkichi, crying tears of joy upon meeting him at Hakoniwa Academy.

                            Ajimu is a very pretty girl, causing Zenkichi to blush the first time he saw her,[5] and even Kumagawa speculates that he fell in love with her because of her looks.[6] She has dark brown eyes and very long, dark brown hair tied up with two yellow ribbons.
                            In the dream world, Ajimu appears as she did in middle school: wearing the girl's uniform of Hakobune Middle School; a sailor uniform comprised of a light pink shirt with a dark red trim, and a matching dark red skirt. She
                            also wears two pink wrist bands and thigh high black socks. Her name is written on her shoes.

                            Charles zi Britannia. He was also the leader and founder of The Black Knights and the real identity of Zero. He is voiced by Jun Fukuyama, while his child self is voiced by Sayaka Ohara. His English dub voice is provided by

                            the true reason for his mother's death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all.

                            Rimuru Tempest (リムル゠テンペスト Rimuru Tenpesuto?) is the main protagonist of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime and the reincarnation of Satoru Mikami.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rimuru is an eccentric and childish person by nature but this shouldn't be mistaken for immaturity and naivety. Underneath the surface Rimuru is constantly analyzing, planning, and weighing the pros and cons of his actions, taking the smart move in the
                            long-term over more rash and emotional decisions. In stark contrast to this normally composed and calculative demeanor, he's absolutely ruthless when it comes to handling people who have angered him. He'll go as far as brutal
                            torture and murder without batting an eye if he can get away with it and uses more subtle methods like intimidation and blackmail when he can't. Rimuru also takes a great deal of care with his personal image, lying on official
                            accounts, erasing memories, and creating forged historical documents to make him come off as a more kind and benevolent person than he actually is in reality. Despite his often selfish and nefarious tendencies, Rimuru does
                            deeply care for his subordinates, viewing them as something like a family or collection of children. And thanks to the memories of Satoru Mikami and Shizue Izawa Rimuru has access to a robust set of human ethics to rely on
                            when his more cruel monster self isn't up to the task. His goal in life is to create a convenient world where he can kick back and lazily enjoy entertainment similar in quality to what is found on Earth.

                            Anos Voldigoad (アノス・ヴォルディゴード Anosu Vorudigōdo?) is a powerful demon who was infamously known during the Mythical Age as the Demon King of Tyranny (暴虐の魔王 Bōgyaku no Maō?), for his immense power and cruelty towards his enemies. After giving up his life
                            to separate the world into four, he reincarnated into the Magical Age and began attending the Demon King Academy, only to be branded as a misfit. He is the titular protagonist of the The Misfit of Demon King Academy.

                            Anos is the reincarnation of the man who was feared as the Demon King of Tyranny two thousand years ago. He is resolute, stalwart, and invincible. His absolute power instils a veritable self-confidence that is only surpassed by his ego. Because of his
                            overwhelming prowess, Anos possesses an easygoing attitude and an unrivaled sense of perseverance when facing any challenge that may come his way. Despite being called the Demon King of Tyranny, Anos has a definitive moral
                            compass and generally has a kind and caring outlook. He takes a great interest in the well-being of not only his family, but also his friends and followers, and is quick to reward them for their loyalty. He is willing to go
                            through great lengths to assist in their development, in order for them to reach their full potential. Other people may see him as cruel, but his personal creed is not to kill people needlessly. Even if he would never admit
                            it, Anos is very protective of his fellow friends and followers. While Anos is not inherently evil, his chaotic and sometimes ruthless methods when dealing with his enemies, earned him his title. While he originally never proclaimed
                            himself as the Demon King, he has openly embraced it as the rest of the world views him as such. Those who oppose him, fear his power, and are threatened by the mere fact that a single man possesses such power. The legends
                            of his gaze striking fear into those who appear before him are not just a rumor either. Just using his Magic Eyes to control others' actions is enough for some to go mentally insane.

                            to join Karasuno, but to join the volleyball team he and Tobio Kageyama, his old opponent in a volleyball match, must overcome their rivalry and work together. For the majority of the series, Hinata was a first-year student
                            at Karasuno High and one of the volleyball team's middle blockers. Hinata has a cheerful and energetic personality. Hinata has an unusually high ability to jump. Since he was young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate for
                            his lack of height.

                            He is easily excited and can be quite loud. For the most part, Hinata is very simple-minded which sometimes causes him to make rash decisions. However, he is also shown to be quite observant. He is capable of reading social cues and can be incredibly
                            empathetic toward others' struggles. As such, he often says just what others need to hear to push themselves in the right direction. His friendly and straightforward personality allows him to befriend even the quietest of people
                            effortlessly, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High. Despite his easy-going personality, Hinata is extremely competitive, especially when it comes to volleyball. Hinata has a very big fortitude to win
                            and thus, doesn't give up easily during a match no matter if it's a practice match or a real match. Hinata can also exhibit a very scary and intimidating face when people underestimate him.

                            of the most complicated demons in the manga.

                            the siblings into demons, as was revealed in the episode. However, at the time when Doma met Daki and Gyutaro, he was Upper-Rank Six. Over time, Doma grew in strength by consuming humans and became Upper-Rank Two.

                            Veldora Tempest (ヴェルドラ゠テンペスト Verudora Tenpesuto?), also known as Storm Dragon Veldora (暴風竜ヴェルドラ Bōfūryū Verudora?) is one of five True Dragons.</p>
                        <p>
                            Veldora is generally boisterous, excitable, but also fairly easy going. Despite his reputation as someone who just wants to rampage, Veldora is largely only dangerous if he doesn't get to unwind once in a while or if his loved ones are threatened. He
                            is also quite energetic, prideful, and has no reservation in showing off his strength. After meeting Rimuru and reading the manga stored in Rimuru's memories, which he refers to as "sacred texts", he began to reconsider some
                            of his more destructive previous behavior. His time spent in Rimuru's stomach with Ifrit and his time spent living in Tempest resulted in Veldora developing a somewhat more patient, analytical, and less impulsive personality.
                            Despite his nonchalant personality, he greatly appreciates Rimuru as his sworn friend and trusts him. Veldora is not good at facing his older sister Velzard, so he avoids contact with her as much as possible. In his mind, Veldora
                            was the baby of his family. He believed that his sisters were only there to torture him. As such, he views Rimuru as his friend and brother figure in that he not only understands Rimuru but also tries to serve as a sort of
                            mentor.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Kanon (カノン Kanon?), commonly known as Hero Kanon (勇者カノン Yūsha Kanon?), was the legendary human hero who fought against the Demon King Anos during the Great War that occurred 2,000 years ago. Kanon was famous for having seven sources that made him nigh-immortal,
                            as well as being the wielder of the legendary holy sword, the Spirit God Human Sword Evansmana.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kanon was a kind and courageous person, as he was noted to have the qualities of a true hero, that many looked up to such as his willingness to fight and die for those who could not fight for themselves, as Kanon was stated to have great charisma that
                            rallied people to him and allowed him to give hope to them. Kanon was sensitive to the hearts of others and very perceptive about the feelings of others, as he could see what people were trying to hide behind their outwards
                            appearances. It is noted that he had great willpower, as he was able to continue battling against Anos and continuously having his sources destroyed, despite the agonizing pain it would cause him. Kanon strived for peace and
                            was compassionate to even his enemies, often letting demons go if he didn't have a reason to kill them. Even after all the hardships that he went through because of Anos during the Great War, Kanon was able to trust in him
                            and his proposal for a peaceful world. After being killed by Jerga's allies, Kanon decided to work alongside demons instead, who were more willing to forgive and forget. As revealed by Lay's deeper and hidden feelings, Kanon
                            was in truth suffocated by the duties of being a hero. As a country boy, all he ever wanted to do was to swing the sword. He was never strong nor righteous, he was afraid of death and never even wanted to kill. But more people
                            had died by his hands than the people he managed to save. But even so, someone had to bring back hope to the people, even at the expense of themselves. As he kept dying and reviving, over and over again, he one day realized
                            that the people had the Hero Kanon, so who did he have? Then one day someone reached out their hands to him, the very person he was supposed to kill, the Demon King of Tyranny Anos Voldigoad, his "only hero".

                            Fitting to her title and attribute, Velgrynd is a hotheaded individual. She doesn't like complex schemes and would act out of emotions at times. The most defining trait of Velgrynd is her undying devotion towards Rudra. She will do anything and everything
                            as long as Rudra desires it, and will fly into rage instantly if anyone dares to insult Rudra in any ways. She is largely disinterested in other matters, and only valued things that Rudra would value.

                                Kayaba Akihiko (茅場晶彦, Kayaba Akihiko?), known as Heathcliff (ヒースクリフ, Hīsukurifu?) in Sword Art Online, was the main antagonist of the Aincrad Arc and a supporting character in the Fairy Dance Arc and Alicization Arc. He was the development director and
                                Game Master (GM) of Sword Art Online, as well as the designer of the NerveGear, the Cardinal System, and The Seed.

                                Kayaba Akihiko choose to fulfill his dream by making a death game which cost thousands of lives, and simply noted that their minds were gone from both worlds. His fascination with computers was very much like Kirito's, with the major difference being
                                Akihiko having no regard for the lives of others, and Kirito doing everything he can to protect them. </p>

                            <p> In spite of this, Akihiko had a level of honor and fairness. He designed Sword Art Online to be a beatable game by anyone who had the skills. He never interfered with the players' progress to keep them from advancing through
                                the game; in fact, as Heathcliff, he was actually fighting on the players' side, helping them clear floors. The one exception to this was the fact that he made himself invincible until his battle with Kirito, although this
                                was necessary to survive the game until the 95th floor was reached, where Heathcliff planned to reveal his true identity and become the final boss on the 100th floor.

                            Ninja Hattori (忍者ハットリくん, Ninja Hattori-kun) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by the Fujiko Fujio duo (and later by Fujiko A. Fujio) which was serialized between 1964 and 1988. It was later adapted into a television drama that aired on
                            TV Asahi from 1966 – 1968; an anime series by Shin-Ei Animation, airing on Asahi from 1981 – 1987; a video game by Hudson Soft; two anime films by Shin-Ei and a live-action film. A remake of the 1981 anime series produced by
                            Shin-Ei and the Indian animation firms Reliance MediaWorks and later Green Gold Animations has aired since 2013.

                        <p>
                            The main antagonists are Kemumaki, a Koga Ninja, and his ninja-cat, Kagechiyo. Kemumaki always causes trouble for Kenichi and Hattori, sometimes inventing new devices to fight against Hattori but always ending up in mishap. Kenichi asking Hattori to take
                            revenge is a recurring storyline present throughout many episodes. Although Hattori is a good friend, Kenichi sometimes fights with him due to misunderstandings created by Kemumaki. Sometimes Jippou, Togejirou and Tsubame help
                            him.

                            Master Roshi ("Old Heavenly Martial Arts Master"), also known as the Turtle Hermit and God of Martial Arts is a perverted hermit and a master of martial arts. He lives on his own isolated island called Kame House, where he may be willing to train students
                            who travel to his doorstep. He is also the originator of the Kamehameha Wave. Despite his lecherous tendencies and his old age, Roshi is an extremely respected and capable warrior, serving as the master of Gohan, Ox-King, Goku,
                            Krillin, and Yamcha. His drive to push his students to new heights and support them on their martial arts journeys makes him one of the most notable supporting characters in the series.

                        <p>
                            Within the series, he is an elderly martial arts master, born on March 20th, who is the innovator of the Kamehameha (カメハメ波) technique. His students include Grandpa Son Gohan, The Ox-King, Son Goku, Krillin and Yamcha. He is bald, sports a thick van dyke
                            beard, and wears sunglasses, beach clothes, or martial arts suits. He usually wields a walking stick and, in early appearances, wears a turtle's shell on his back. In spite of his lechery, cantankerousness and occasional whimsy
                            or foolishness, he is often depicted as wise and perceptive. While a popular character with Dragon Ball fans, the depiction of some of his antics has been met with criticism or deemed highly controversial.

                            her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is currently one of only two people in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs,
                            a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government.

                            Arabasta Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century. She gained a bounty of 79,000,000 berry at the age of 8 due to her
                            ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara, it later increased to 80,000,000 berry after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby to rescue her and escape, and to 130,000,000 berry after the Dressrosa Arc. Currently,
                            following the events from Raid on Onigashima, her bounty is raised to 930,000,000 berry.

                            keeps tucked behind her ear. She consistently wears small gold hoop earrings on both ears. Her hair is apparently natural due to her not minding too much when Future Trunks sliced parts of it off during his fight with her She
                            has a fairly small chest in the manga, while in the anime, her chest was implied to be large enough that Master Roshi after their plane crashed took the opportunity to plant his face in her bosom and motion his face around,
                            leading to her nearly killing him.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Yatora Yaguchi (矢や口ぐち八や虎とら Yaguchi Yatora?) is the protagonist of the manga series Blue Period. He is a second-year high school student with remarkably high grades despite his delinquent lifestyle. Yatora feels like his life is dull and predictable, that
                            is, until he comes across his senpai, Maru Mori, painting in the school's art club. He discovers his passion for painting and dedicates his remaining school years to it, aiming to pass the Tokyo University of the Arts entrance
                            exam.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although Yatora is very hardworking and looks composed, there is an underlying insecure part of him that is further exposed when he starts making art. He has an extroverted nature and can easily understand what others are looking for in a relationship,
                            further adapting himself in order to please everyone around him. For that reason, he tends to oppress his own feelings and wishes. Yatora relies a lot on his studied social skills whenever he is under a stressful or unfamiliar
                            situation, but when he is caught by surprise or can't keep up his composed act he has an emotional outburst, often resulting in him crying and speaking more honestly. Yatora is especially hard on himself, putting high standards
                            on himself while constantly undervaluing his own work and comparing himself to others, which ends up overwhelming him. Whilst comparing himself with others, he has great respect and admires the art that others around him create.
                            His selfless and worried nature is better shown when he goes on a trip with Ayukawa, despite it being in the middle of exam season and him breaking out in rashes due to extreme stress.

                            Mello (メロ, Mero) is the older of L's two successors raised at Wammy's House, Watari's orphanage for gifted children in Winchester, England. When Roger asks that Mello and Near work together to capture Kira, Mello refuses, pointing out the differences
                            between them. He leaves the orphanage soon after and eventually seeks help from the Mafia.

                            Mello is a young man with chin-length golden-blond hair and blue eyes. His bangs hang down just over his eyebrows, and he stands at about average height. He later gains a large scar, which begins somewhere between his shoulder and waist and extends up
                            to just between his nose and left eye, after initiating an explosion in the Mafia hideout in order to escape being captured. Mello is usually seen wearing dark leather clothes.

                            collar on the inside of the material, with a green logo painted on the back.

                            After being chipped in, David—while still expelled—returned the following day to the academy, in search of a rematch with Katsuo. Utilizing his Sandevistan implant, David easily floored Katsuo with a single blow to the head and broke his nose. Once returned
                            home, David stared at the urn holding his mother's ashes, when he received a call from the academy's principal. The principal told David that his expulsion had been formally processed, but before the principal could end his
                            sentence, David ended the conversation. The next morning, making his way to the academy, he noticed that the mysterious girl was aboard the NCART train, stealing shards from unsuspecting corporate employees on their way to
                            City Center. The woman attempted to also take David's shards, but was quickly intercepted by David utilizing his implant. He grasped her arm, which she shrugged off and instead took him with her to the end of the cart, and
                            interrogated David on why he was messing with her “job”. After a short discussion, the two came to an agreement to work together, Lucy taking on David as her trainee, and split their earnings seventy-to-thirty. After a short
                            confrontation with an ambulance worker who wanted to steal David's Sandevistan to sell on the black market, David stays the night at Lucy's apartment, where she tells him her dream of leaving Night City to live on the moon,
                            and shares a braindance with him. The two bond during this experience, but while David is asleep Lucy calls her team of mercs to her apartment. Maine, Dorio, and Pilar arrive and confront David about the stolen Sandevistan,
                            which Gloria had originally planned to sell to Maine. After David reveals that Gloria had died, and demonstrates an extreme tolerance for cyberware, he's given a chance to join their group, on the condition that he proves himself
                            in a small-scale data heist.

                            Yamamoto during their first year in high school.

                            Because of his reserved nature, Kenma does not often voice his opinions since he is afraid of what others might think of him and does not like standing out or being noticed in any way. His shy tendencies also prevent him from being very approachable and
                            because of this, he has a difficult time making friends; with Kuroo being stated to have been the only friend he's made since elementary school. He also is not fond of the authority that comes with being an upperclassman and
                            doesn't expect his junior's to automatically respect him; often reminding Lev that he does not need to be so formal with him.

                            awkward. He is incapable of "reading the atmosphere," which has lead to him having a lack of friends.

                            to be a Tamer. She is kind and has an abiding love of gardening, but often lacks confidence in herself. Before the series, Shiemi never went out of her home and tended to the garden with her grandmother. After her grandmother

                            and Renzo. She also earns Izumo's friendship despite being initially used and mistreated by her. Shiemi becomes devastated upon learning Rin's secret, feeling she is not trustworthy enough to them to have initially included
                            her with this knowledge. However, on the Kyoto mission, she reconciles with Rin upon seeing how much he is suffering as a result of his nature.[ch. 26] Shiemi has the talent to become a Tamer and can summon a reliable Greenman
                            spirit that can produce healing herbs and plant-related barriers. Shiemi is shown to have great inner strength as she can keep her Greenman around for extended periods without tiring. Her Greenman is able to understand her
                            way of naming plants and is able to produce the correct one when asked.

                            can be considered a supporting antagonist of the Baratie Arc and one of the major antagonists in the Marineford Arc, where he took part in the Summit War of Marineford on the side of the Marines, along with most of the other
                            Warlords of the Sea.

                            Suzaku Kururugi (枢木 スザク / くるるぎすざく), Kururugi Suzaku), 17 years old (18 at R2), is the deuteragonist of the Sunrise anime series Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, one of the antagonists of Code Geass: Akito the Exiled, and one of the protagonists of
                            Code Geass: Lancelot & Guren.

                            Suzaku is a young man with light brown hair and forest green eyes. He is rather tall, being slightly shorter than Lelouch. Like most characters in the series, he also is rather skinny, belying his extreme physical prowess. He is usually clothed in a white
                            knightmare frame battle suit or the Ashford Academy uniform, and is also seen wearing a prison outfit and a soldier's uniform on separate occasions. However, in the second, he often wears regal clothing with a long blue cloak
                            of the Knights of the Round which was more decorated and ornamented upon becoming the Knight of Zero and a different knightmare battle suit. His long blue cloak becomes black upon becoming the Knight of Zero. <br>                            Suzaku is the son of Japan's last prime minister, Genbu Kururugi. His existence was kept a secret from the public until after the war. Suzaku met Lelouch vi Britannia and his sister Nunnally vi Britannia when they moved to
                            the Kururugi residence as a diplomatic peace trade. At first, Suzaku despised Lelouch because he thought that he was a prince who didn't care about anyone. As time passed by, however, he came to know Lelouch better, and they
                            soon became best friends.

                            Alucard is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Hellsing manga and anime series created by Kouta Hirano. A vampire devoted entirely to the current head of the Hellsing family, Integra Hellsing, Alucard works with the Hellsing Organization
                            against other vampires and evil forces, fighting with ferocity and cruelty, sometimes only killing after a target has been disabled and humiliated, while frequently allowing enemies more than one chance to kill him (though
                            only seeking to be killed by a human, having grown bored of immortality and life). Count Dracula was defeated by Abraham Van Helsing and became the family's loyal servant. Decades later, Abraham's direct descendant Arthur Hellsing
                            gives the Count the codename "Alucard". Hellsing is set over a hundred years later, where Alucard and the Hellsing Organization are forced to fight the remnants of a Nazi battalion. Alucard also appears in the prequel series
                            Hellsing: The Dawn, taking a female form alongside his partner Walter C. Dornez to end World War II in a fight against Nazis.

                        <p>
                            Hirano created Alucard as a strong individual who would be deus ex machina on his own, resulting in an easy defeat of most enemies. Alucard is voiced by Jouji Nakata in Japanese and Crispin Freeman in English. Critical response to the character has been
                            positive for Alucard's dark traits such as sadism or supernatural abilities that make him stand out as excessively violent despite being the main hero. Alucard's design also stood out for being called "stylish", praising his
                            outfits and weaponry. Alucard's voice portrayals by Nakata and Freeman were also met with a positive response.

                            inside of them being pinkish peach color. On its back is a hot pink egg-shaped oval that can flip open to remove Grief Seed fragments.

                            The Scarred Man (傷の男, Kizu no Otoko), known more casually as "Scar" (スカー, Sukā), is a nameless lone serial killer and vigilante who targets State Alchemists for his own brand of lethal justice in accordance with the fundamental tenets of his religion
                            and for the revenge of his slaughtered people and family. An Ishvalan survivor of the Ishvalan Civil War, Scar's moniker comes from the large X-shaped scar on his forehead and sports a conspicuous and intricate alchemical tattoo
                            on his right arm, which originally belonged to his older brother, and which he uses as his murder weapon of choice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Use of Alchemy - While his physical prowess and intimidating figure are frightful in and of themselves, Scar's most dangerous element is his right arm, which is able to destroy anything with which it comes into contact by way of the intricate and arcane
                            Transmutation Array tattooed thereupon. As a fundamentalist opponent of alchemy, Scar does not consider himself an alchemist in the traditional sense, but the strain of alchemy that his arm itself allows him to produce is powerful,
                            advanced and unique. As observed by those who have seen it in action and lived to tell the tale, Scar's method follows the cyclical flow of transmutation, but only takes into account the first two steps - comprehension and
                            deconstruction. By "stopping at the second step", the physical structure of whatever he targets is broken down and not reshaped, essentially reducing it to debris. By applying this method to his victims, he destroys their internal
                            systems (general organs in the manga, but the brain specifically in the 2003 anime version) instantly while circumventing both Human Transmutation and the Ishvalan stigma associated with giving new form to one of God's creations.
                            In the 2003 anime, he is able to destroy Chimeras by blowing them up, reducing their bodies to bloody splatters. Still, for all the serial killer's anti-alchemical posturing, the fact that he is unable to deconstruct an object
                            whose composition he does not comprehend suggests that Scar does have a fair bit of alchemical knowledge and must actively identify, or at least make educated guesses at, the makeup of objects he wishes to destroy; despite
                            his repeated assertion that the arm (and not himself) is the one performing alchemy, Scar is an amateur alchemist by practice.

                            Goku's second stint in the afterlife wasn't anywhere near as memorable or as interesting as the first but it did at least yield a new fan-favorite character in the form of Pikkon. Similar in appearance to a Namekian and with a similar moral stance to
                            Goku, Pikkon is the strongest student of the West Kai and competes with Goku during the Other World Martial Arts Tournament. Surprisingly, Pikkon easily rivals Goku's Super Saiyan strength, pushing him to ascend to Super Saiyan
                            3, and his ability is further demonstrated when he easily disposes of Frieza and Cell during their trouble-making spree in the afterlife.

                        <p>
                            Pikkon's extremely alien appearance and unique fighting style undoubtedly make him one of the most interesting rarely seen characters in the anime. Although largely a filler creation, Pikkon made a big impression during his fleeting appearances in the
                            franchise and it’s a shame that his presence is so limited.

                                Due to her tendency to charge into battle with a rapier despite being
                                a healer, she has earned the nickname «Berserk Healer» (バーサクヒーラー, Bāsaku

                                Asuna has also created an alternative avatar, the Sylph «Erika» (エリカ,
                                Erika?), as she
                                sometimes wanted to change her appearance.

                            Mai Sakurajima (桜島 麻衣, Sakurajima Mai) is the main character of the Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai series. She is a notable actress/model and a third year at Minegahara High School, the same school as Sakuta Azusagawa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mai is a serious individual, especially around Sakuta Azusagawa. She is very sensitive, polite, levelheaded, helpful, and kind. She isn't harsh by default, but she can become easily annoyed and come across as somewhat snappy or violent especially to Sakuta.
                            Mai tends to ignore and stuff down unpleasant feelings rather than deal with them. Sakuta often points out that she is "dishonest", often lying about her feelings. Despite her snarkiness, she's pure-hearted and even shy around
                            Sakuta's jokes. Mai is also very intelligent; she's implied to have very good grades and even helps Sakuta study at one point.

                            Chōji Akimichi (秋道チョウジ, Akimichi Chōji) is a member of Konohagakure's Akimichi Clan. Though sensitive about his weight, Chōji is nevertheless dedicated to his friends, especially in Team Asuma.

                            Chōji was born into the Akimichi clan, and is slated to become the Sixteenth Head of the Akimichi (秋道16代目当主, Akimichi Jūrokudaime Tōshu) after his father, Chōza. When Chōji was younger, he was often put down for not being good at a child's game called
                            "Ninja", which appears to be a cross between tag and hide and seek, often employing the use of shuriken made out of cardboard and sticks. His peers would always berate him, telling him that any team that he was on was bound
                            to lose. One day, they simply refused to let him play at all. However, Shikamaru Nara stuck up for him, saying that the teams would be uneven if Chōji didn't join them. This gave Chōji a little hope, although, in the end, they
                            still refused to let him play.

                            a black stocking on the left one. She carries a brown staff with a floating red gem.

                            Tomoe tends to be cunning and sly as well as seemingly unaware of his own attractiveness but knows when to use his charms and handsome appearance when necessary to do so. He has a tendency to mock others due to him not being able to trust others that
                            easily, such as at the beginning of the series where he said that there was no way a human girl like Nanami Momozono could be a god. He was very cold and condescending towards Nanami at first, but eventually warmed up to her
                            and fell in love with her over time. Tomoe is extremely powerful and is capable of using kitsunebi, or fox-fire as well as using enchanted leaves to transform or control others.

                        <p>
                            He has a short temper, often shouting or telling Nanami off for being late home or for being clumsy, and is also quite straightforward and blunt, telling Nanami that she is annoying when she asked him about it one day. However, he has a strong sense of
                            loyalty and pride, as well as very protective towards those he cares about.

                            He played as regular player in 3 seasons. In 2008, he moved to Regional Leagues club Banditonce Kakogawa. In 2009, he moved to Prefectural Leagues club Volador Matsue. He retired end of 2009 season.

                            Zorc is the second most powerful duel monster spirit in the Yugioh Universe, weaker only to The Creator God of Light, Horakhty (the fused form of the Egyptian Gods). He is shown to be able to defeat all of the most powerful duel monster spirits, including
                            the Egyptian Gods and Exodia, and was only able to be stopped when the gods fused together, forming Horakhty herself.

                            Trigun (Japanese: トライガン, Hepburn: Toraigan) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhiro Nightow. Trigun was first serialized in Tokuma Shoten's shōnen manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Captain from April 1995 to January 1997, when the magazine
                            ceased its publication; its chapters were collected in three tankōbon volumes. The series continued its publication in Shōnen Gahosha's seinen manga magazine Young King OURs, under the title Trigun Maximum

                        <p>
                            Set on the fictional planet known as No Man's Land, the plot follows Vash the Stampede, a famous gunman who is constantly fighting bounty hunters seeking to obtain the immense bounty on his head. As the narrative progresses, Vash's past is explored. Trigun
                            originated from Nightow's fascination with Western movies.

                            Annie Leonhart (アニ・レオンハート Ani Reonhāto?) is a graduate of the 104th Cadet Corps and former member of the Military Police Regiment. Her exceptional skill with swords and unarmed combat earned her the 4th rank, but she is noted to be a lone wolf that struggles
                            to work with others.

                            She possesses the ability to transform into a Titan known as the Female Titan. She trained from an early age by her father, and is selected as one of Marley's Warriors. In the year 845, she is sent on a mission to retrieve the Founding Titan, along with
                            her fellow Warriors Reiner Braun, Bertholdt Hoover, and Marcel Galliard. As the Female Titan, she served as a major antagonist prior to being exposed and defeated by the Scout Regiment. After her defeat, she crystallized herself
                            and was left in a comatose state. She was held underground for approximately four years before escaping during a battle between the Military, the Jaegerists, and the forces of Marley.

                            Pariston has medium-length, dark blond hair and brown eyes. He is known for his wide, cheerful smiles. Unlike many of the other members of the Zodiacs, he does not change his appearance to look like the animal that he represents. Instead, Pariston is
                            always seen wearing luxurious suits and ties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to his extreme unpredictability, slyness, shadiness and the tendency to test anyone's patience and temper, he is disliked by all of the Zodiacs and many Hunters in the Association, even more than Ging. Even Morel states that he would rather die than
                            vote for a slew rat-like Pariston. It is also shown that Netero also cannot stand him and often gets into a lot of arguments with him, but he tolerates Pariston's presence because he believes that a yes-man second-in-command
                            is too boring for him.

                            for the village's protection, B aspires to be the world's greatest rapper.

                            Release: Double Lariat with A. As such he was given the name "B", and A stated they would be brothers from that day on.[2] Since the age of five, B has been best friends with Motoi, whom he always greeted with a fist bump.
                            After A's cousin, the jinchūriki of Gyūki lost control and killed Motoi's father along with seven other ninja on that day, B was chosen as its next jinchūriki.[3] Soon afterwards, B suffered from similar prejudices against
                            jinchūriki, not too different from that the villagers of Konohagakure and Sunagakure had against Naruto Uzumaki and Gaara respectively. However, he kept smiling and pushed himself to be the best jinchūriki that he could be,
                            so that his brother wouldn't be hurt politically as the Fourth Raikage.

                            Before the term of the Fourth Mizukage, Yagura Karatachi, Kirigakure began the practice of pitting Kirigakure Academy graduates against each other in death matches as a final exam with the exceptionally skilled students named prime candidates for the
                            Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist. After Zabuza, not yet a student himself, killed over one hundred Academy students,[5] the practice was discontinued and he would thereafter be known as the "Demon of the Hidden Mist". His
                            fame grew over the years as he became an Anbu, killing the Konohagakure ninja Kumade Toriichi at that time, before finally joining the Seven Swordsmen. At some point, he discovered Haku, a child with a special kekkei genkai
                            and began training him to be the ultimate weapon. In the anime, he and Haku witnessed the Kaguya clan attacking Kirigakure yet chose not to help his village. Soon after, they encountered Kimimaro, the soon-to-be-sole survivor
                            of the Kaguya. Although Haku wanted to talk to the boy, Zabuza forced him to leave Kimimaro alone and keep moving.

                            Haku was born in a small, snowy village in the Land of Water, a land that had suffered from war not long before. In this war, different sides battled each other using ninja, some of whom possessed kekkei genkai. After the war ended, memories of the horrific
                            battles still lingered in the minds of the people. Those with kekkei genkai quickly became feared and hated for their abilities, out of concern that their existence would only bring about more war.

                            Tenten (テンテン, Tenten) is a kunoichi from Konohagakure and a member of Team Guy. While initially wanting to be like the legendary Sannin Tsunade, she realised that she did not have the necessary chakra control to be a medical-nin. However, she did not
                            give up on being a powerful kunoichi, putting her all into perfecting her weaponry and fūinjutsu skills.

                            Rock Lee and Neji Hyūga. For their final test to become genin, Guy forced his potential students to spar him and see their commitment to succeed. Ultimately, all three passed.[6] During this time of trial and failure, trying
                            to emulate Tsunade, Tenten attempted to become a medical-nin, building up her raw strength and such. While each failed attempt was damaging to her pride, Tenten later discovered her talent for fūinjutsu and thus developed her
                            unique fighting style. Realising her own nature, she stopped trying to become like Tsunade, but still has not given up on her dream of becoming a legendary kunoichi in her own right.[7] Later, Tenten and her teammates were

                            holding a public execution for Ace and attempting to personally kill both him and Luffy during the Marineford War to ensure the security of the World Government.

                            Reaper-like appearance, with black skin and white bone-like markings. Despite its effectiveness, the curse has many requirements, and can be a slow technique to employ. The curse can be avoided if the opponent happens to know
                            what to look out for, and knows of Hidan's inability to die. The link between Hidan's curse and his opponent could be broken prematurely if Hidan was removed from the symbol; However, Hidan would remain in his transformed state,
                            allowing the curse to be easily re-established by him simply entering the symbol's borders once more.

                            Killer B is a major supporting character in the anime and manga Naruto Shippuden. He is the host of Gyuki, The Eight-tailed demon Ox. He was a shinobi who trained Naruto and is partners with him while fighting Obito Uchiha. Killer B is very proud of his
                            own power and by extension of who he is, regardless of his status and upbringing as a jinchūriki. Like Naruto Uzumaki, who has great overconfidence at times, Killer B can be quite cocky and stubborn, especially in terms of
                            his own strength, demanding respect from others and asks to be called "Lord Jinchūriki" (人柱力様, Jinchūriki-sama) and his tailed beast be called "Lord Eight-Tails" (八尾様, Hachibi-sama).

                        <p>
                            B has a special way of expressing his pride through song, more specifically in rap-style and tends to use "Bakayarō! Konoyarō!" (「バカヤロー!コノヤロー!, Viz: Fool! Ya Fool!) when referring or speaking to others. He will even write his rhymes in the middle of a
                            fight, or during an important meeting, even if they are no good, which is usually the case.

                            Discerning, intelligent, and widely respected, Erwin was an able commander. While he cared deeply for his men, he did not hesitate to sacrifice them for the good and prosperity of mankind, and his men proved more than willing to stake their lives at his
                            order. During Erwin's career he developed the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation, and due to uncertainty about his future, he later named Hange Zoë as his successor.

                            After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the
                            villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become
                            the village's Seventh Hokage.

                            and the Heavens Arena arc, before becoming a supporting character during the Yorknew City arc and Greed Island arc. During the 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc, he reprises his role as a secondary antagonist.

                            Arguably the template for other characters on this list like Vash, Kenshin brought to the anime scene a unique trait: He was a killer who wouldn't kill anymore. After years of being a hired sword and killing countless foes, he makes a vow to never deal
                            in death again. But his vow is tested time and time again as less virtuous people endanger the country's peace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kenshin was a refreshing change of pace in the samurai genre of his time. He was quite feminine, often mistaken for a woman by viewers who weren't in the know. He was also one of the most polite characters in anime history, frequently putting others before
                            himself and speaking to them with the utmost respect and patience. On the surface, he's a model nice guy, the kind of person you'd expect to be a teacher or a florist, not a warrior trying to atone for years of bloodshed.

                           Iruka Umino is a chūnin of Konohagakure, who served primarily as an instructor at the Academy until being promoted to Headmaster years later.</p>
                            <p>
                         Iruka's parents were killed in the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack twelve years before the beginning of the series. With his family gone, much like Naruto Iruka had no one to give him attention. Iruka thereafter became a prankster, trying to gain attention to stave off his loneliness.

Gin is a chill and nonchalant forward who strives to be the best in the world along with the others of Blue Lock. When first arriving at Blue Lock, he was a member of Team Z during First Selection. Before Third Selection started, he was ranked #88 and he later started as goalie for the Blue Lock Eleven team against the Japan U-20. He currently plays as goalie for Bastard München during the Neo Egoist League.

                            Power has the appearance of a young woman with mid-back length hair. Her hair color varies from blonde to pink in manga illustrations, and appears blonde with a pinkish tint in the anime. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a fiend, she has red and yellow eyes that form a cross pattern, sharp teeth with defined fangs, and light red horns protruding from the top of her head. If Power accumulates too much blood, her horns become larger and more curved, and she can sprout additional pairs of horns from the sides of her head.[2]

Power usually wears the standard dress shirt, tie, and slacks required of Public Safety Demon Hunters. Normally, she wears breast pads to increase the size of her bust. She almost always wears her jacket hanging halfway off her body giving her an untidy, half-dressed appearance.

                            Makima is one of the strongest individuals in the world of the Chainsaw Man thanks to her physical and supernatural abilities as a devil, along with her cunning and manipulative personality. She is feared by humans, fiends and devils all around the world, which also increased her powers as a devil.

                        <p>
                            As a devil, Makima possesses all of the standard devil abilities. These include the ability to make contracts with humans. Thanks to her ability to control humans, she is also able to force them to make a contract with herself. Makima has a contract with the Prime Minister of Japan in exchange of working for Japan. As a result of her contract with the Prime Minister, any fatal damage inflicted to Makima is transferred into an appropriate illness or ailment affecting a random citizen of Japan. She was shown to have been shot in the back of the head and seemingly killed, only to stand up later with no visible wounds. She stated that she was merely grazed by a bullet, however, this is unlikely given the placement of the gun when it was fired, as well as the location of the blood from the exit wound

The little girl belonged to a tiny island in the Pacific, called the Kingdom of Molmol and she just happened to be its young princess as well.

                             Born as the eldest son of the Bael Clan, Sairaorg did not inherit the Bael's trademark Power of Destruction that Rias and Sirzech's inherited from their mother, who came from the Bael Clan. Because of this, his younger half-brother was appointed to be the next heir of the Bael Clan. His mother told him to become strong in different ways.

                            <p>
                            Sairaorg trained his body to its limits to become powerful and due to this, he defeated his younger half-brother, which made him the next heir of the Bael Clan. After his defeat, the younger half-brother now plans on assassinating Sairaorg. Sairaorg desires to become Satan to prove himself even with his lack of special demonic powers.

				  Satoru Fujinuma is the protagonist of Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (Erased) who seems, at first, like a regular guy
				  but later on is faced with an unexplainable situation where he travels into the past. He possesses an ability called "Revival ", which helps him travel back in time but the only catch is that he cannot control it.
				</p>
				<p>
				  He has blue eyes, tall stance and wears spectacles. He seems to smile very seldom although his younger version was quite ful of 
				  energy almost all the time and laughed cheerfully.
