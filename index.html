                                    anime series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                                    strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of
                                    Konoha (or Leaf Village).</p>
                                <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's
                                    chakra, which is much greater than
                                    the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely
                                    grant Naruto his power unless they
                                    were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the
                                    fox by his name, Kurama. At this
                                    point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>
