                                <p class="card-text">
                                    Satoru Gojo is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a
                                    special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world.
                                    Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first
                                    person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He
                                    works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and
                                    train strong young allies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Satoru is a tall man with a lean build in his later twenties who is considered
                                    relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and
                                    the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru
                                    normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold which props up his hair and gives it
                                    a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses
                                    and let his hair down to reach the base of his
                                    neck. While working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high collar
                                    that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit matching black pants and black dress
                                    boots.

                                <p class="card-text">Naruto Uzumaki is the main protagonist in the popular manga and
                                    anime series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                                    strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of
                                    Konoha (or Leaf Village).</p>
                                <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's
                                    chakra, which is much greater than
                                    the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely
                                    grant Naruto his power unless they
                                    were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the
                                    fox by his name, Kurama. At this
                                    point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                                    down and kill demons, and later swore to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji, the King of Demons,

                                    Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan.
                                    He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju,
                                    with the intention of beginning an era of peace.

                                    When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of
                                    the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his
                                    death and went into hiding to work on his own plans.
                                    Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to
                                    Obito shortly before his actual death.

                                    One-Punch Man (Japanese: ワンパンマン, Hepburn: Wanpanman) is a Japanese superhero manga
                                    series created by One. It tells the story of Saitama, a superhero who, because he
                                    can defeat any opponent with a single punch, grows bored from a lack of challenge.
                                    One wrote the original webcomic manga version in early 2009.

                                    The words "the ends justify the means" were his mantra....

                                    Lelouch was one of the best examples of a hero gone astray. As often happens in
                                    dramatic stories, his good intentions paved a road to a dark place.
                                    His rise and downfall is almost Shakespearean in nature, as his own pride and
                                    arrogance cloud his judgment and he misses out on what was truly important.
                                    But at least he did it all with a sense of dramatic flair! His alter ego Zero,
                                    complete with mysterious helmet and flowing cape, was an iconic tool to secure a
                                    place in the psyche of both his enemies and his followers.
                                    In the end, Lelouch's plans are successful, though not in the way anyone ever
                                    expected.

                                    clan, sparing only Sasuke. He appears working as a terrorist from the organisation

                                    several writers, although some have considered his initial appearance to be
                                    unsurprising.

                                    Sasuke Uchiha is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan.
                                    After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission
                                    in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a
                                    ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki,
                                    Sasuke starts developing his skills.

                                    Dissatisfied with his progress, he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the
                                    strength needed to exact his revenge. His years of seeking vengeance and his actions
                                    that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from
                                    others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the
                                    truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth
                                    Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to
                                    Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants,
                                    becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage".

                                    Obito Uchiha (うちはオビト, Uchiha Obito) was a member of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. He
                                    was believed to have died during the Third Shinobi World War, his only surviving

                                    In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara, but the events of the
                                    war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create
                                    an ideal world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ, Tobi) and Madara Uchiha
                                    himself, Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance
                                    his machinations, eventually going public and starting the Fourth Shinobi World War.

                                    strongest man in the world, a fact complimented by having the highest active bounty
                                    whilst alive, and the second highest bounty of any pirate in history.

                                    genjutsu. However, he overcomes those shortcomings by undergoing special training
                                    from Might Guy that would make him a taijutsu master while still a genin.

                                    Under Guy's leadership, Lee has acquired a number of his sensei's personality
                                    traits: he is energetic, optimistic, and hot-blooded, and shows the epitome of a
                                    "nice guy". He believes that one cannot dislike food and shows strong dedication to
                                    his promises; when this promise is broken, just barely, he assigns himself arduous
                                    training to prevent it from happening again.

                                    than Tokyo Ghoul's Ken Kaneki. The one-eyed ghoul's story is truly a tragedy, but
                                    fans admire him for several reasons. Many consider Kaneki one of the best anime
                                    protagonists of all time.</p>

                                <p>Ken Kaneki is a man of many layers, and just as many flaws. Kaneki's journey in Tokyo
                                    Ghoul is one of suffering, pain, and a gruesome, nightmarish reality. The series
                                    depicts a constant tug-of-war between Kaneki's ghoul side fighting against his
                                    humanity..</p>

                                    Kai is a proud and a very confident blader who is willing to sacrifice everything to get what he wants. He doesn't mind crushing people on the way up though he would much prefer earning things through hard work. He doesn't like to lose and feels frustrated and upset whenever he does. However, when he returns to his old self, he does so with an even stronger determination to win. This is a trait he shares with his Phoenix Bit-Beast, Suzaku. He is a quiet and mysterious person.

                                    Near (ニア, Nia) is the younger of L's two successors, raised in Wammy's House—Watari's orphanage for gifted children in Winchester, England. After L's death, Near begins his investigation of the Kira case, gathering evidence over a period of four years. Near takes his findings to the President of the United States and reveals himself to be the true successor of L. Soon after, Near becomes the head of the Special Provision for Kira and continues the hunt for Kira. After making contact with "L" (Light Yagami), Near begins to suspect that he is also Kira.

                                    Near is a young, slender, fair-skinned man with a petite build, gray eyes, and short, shaggy platinum blonde hair which he often plays with. He is only seen wearing a white, long-sleeved pajama top and white pajama pants. In the anime, Near's pants are light blue. In the Death Note One-Shot Special, which takes place three years after the end of the Kira case, Near is shown to have sharp bags under his eyes, slightly longer hair, and to have undergone a growth spurt. He sits in a posture similar to L's and is often seen being expressionless.

                                    Even though Izuku was born Quirkless, he manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero All Might, due to his innate heroism and a strong sense of justice, and has since become his close pupil, as well as a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School. All Might passed on his transferable Quirk to Izuku, making him the ninth holder of One For All.

He was hailed as a hero for his bravery and quick thinking during a conflict with an unknown, powerful force.
                                    

                                   On October 10th, Minato Namikaze died while defending the village from this powerful attack, but not before sealing the beast inside his newborn son Naruto.

                                    Majin Buu (魔ま人じんブウ Majin Bū, lit. "Demon Person Boo") has many forms, all of which are linked below. However, each form has a different personality and goals, essentially making them separate individuals. All of Majin Buu's forms are simply referred to as "Majin Buu" in the series, but the various forms get their common names from various Dragon Ball Z video games.
