                                    anime series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                                    strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of
                                    Konoha (or Leaf Village).</p>
                                <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's
                                    chakra, which is much greater than
                                    the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely
                                    grant Naruto his power unless they
                                    were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the
                                    fox by his name, Kurama. At this
                                    point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                                    Satoru Gojo is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a
                                    special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world.
                                    Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first
                                    person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He
                                    works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and
                                    train strong young allies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Satoru is a tall man with a lean build in his later twenties who is considered
                                    relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and
                                    the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru
                                    normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold which props up his hair and gives it
                                    a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses
                                    and let his hair down to reach the base of his
                                    neck. While working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high collar
                                    that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit matching black pants and black dress
                                    boots.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Akuto has an incredible amount of power within him that sometimes gets out of
                                    control. Akuto has a highly serious personality but not without some humor. In the
                                    manga, he has much more of a temper, and, in a fight, is unwilling to hold anything
                                    back. In the anime, he tries to restrain himself in order to convince everyone that
                                    he has no desire to be the Demon King.

                                    Powers:

                                    Akuto is capable of controlling and manipulating "mana", a magical energy that
                                    resides in the bodies of living things and in surroundings. For instance, he is able
                                    to absorb the mana of a large demon dog, thus transforming it back into a normal
                                    puppy, a feat that has never been performed before. However, his immense power is
                                    also highly volatile and most of his early attempts at controlling mana and creating
                                    magical projectiles, no matter how benign they are supposed to be, resulted in
                                    catastrophic explosions.
                                    His name is phonetically very similar to a Japanese phrase meaning "Great/Ultimate
                                    villain".

                                    With the Straw Hats taking down the Beasts Pirates, they have once again caught the
                                    eye of the World Government,
                                    who wasted no time in issuing new bounties to the crew. The bounty system has caused
                                    controversies in the past
                                    as many One Piece fans tend to think that it is a representation of a character's
                                    power. This time, it is Sanji's
                                    new bounty that has sparked many debates as it is lower than Zoro and Jimbei's
                                    bounties.

                                    Levi Ackerman is one of the most popular characters in the Attack on Titan series,
                                    who is a captain of the Special Operation Squad and in the Survey Corps, whose
                                    abilities cannot be underestimated.

                                    Levi is a captain who has exceptional skills on the battlefield. Not only that, he
                                    also has enough strategic intelligence to make him a formidable opponent.

                                    He has an even expression despite his great abilities, ranging from fighting to
                                    completing homework. That’s the reason why Levi is so beloved by fans of the Attack
                                    on Titan manga and anime.

                                    Brock, known as Takeshi (タケシ) in Japan, is a fictional character in the Pokémon
                                    franchise owned by Nintendo. In the Pokémon video games, he is the Gym Leader of
                                    Pewter City and mainly uses Rock-type Pokémon. In the anime series, Ash comes across
                                    a man that is later revealed to be Brock's father.

                                    leaving, Brock had to take care of his many, many siblings and could not leave. This
                                    is why he became a gym leader, to stay close to his family. His father comes back
                                    and states that he will take care of the family. Brock left his position as a Gym
                                    Leader to travel alongside Ash Ketchum and became a revered Pokémon breeder. He
                                    later cultivates his skill in medicine, and goes to Pewter City in order to train
                                    and become a Pokémon doctor. He has also appeared in several Pokémon manga series,
                                    including Pokémon Adventures and the Ash & Pikachu manga.

                                    One-Punch Man (Japanese: ワンパンマン，Hepburn: Wanpanman) is a Japanese superhero manga
                                    series created by One. It tells the story of Saitama, a superhero who, because he
                                    can defeat any opponent with a single punch, grows bored from a lack of challenge.
                                    One wrote the original webcomic manga version in early 2009.

                                    Lelouch was one of the best examples of a hero gone astray. As often happens in
                                    dramatic stories, his good intentions paved a road to a dark place.
                                    His rise and downfall is almost Shakespearean in nature, as his own pride and
                                    arrogance cloud his judgment and he misses out on what was truly important.
                                    But at least he did it all with a sense of dramatic flair! His alter ego Zero,
                                    complete with mysterious helmet and flowing cape, was an iconic tool to secure a
                                    place in the psyche of both his enemies and his followers.
                                    In the end, Lelouch's plans are successful, though not in the way anyone ever
                                    expected.

                                    unsurprising.

                                    Sasuke Uchiha is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan.
                                    After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission
                                    in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a
                                    ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki,
                                    Sasuke starts developing his skills.

                                    strength needed to exact his revenge. His years of seeking vengeance and his actions
                                    that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from
                                    others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the
                                    truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth
                                    Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to
                                    Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants,
                                    becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage".

                                    war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create
                                    an ideal world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ，Tobi) and Madara Uchiha
                                    himself, Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance
                                    his machinations, eventually going public and starting the Fourth Shinobi World War.

                                    Once a promising child soldier at the service of the Vodka Kingdom decades ago,
                                    Kaidou was drafted against his will by the Marines but managed to escape and start a
                                    career in piracy. He was invited by Edward Newgate to join the legendary Rocks
                                    Pirates as an apprentice, where he met and befriended Charlotte Linlin. During the
                                    God Valley Incident when the Rocks Pirates met their downfall, Linlin provided
                                    Kaidou with the rare Mythical Zoan fruit, the Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu. He then
                                    went on to form his own crew and build it up into a powerful military force
                                    determined to challenge the World Government.

                                <p>Ken Kaneki is a man of many layers, and just as many flaws. Kaneki's journey in Tokyo
                                    Ghoul is one of suffering, pain, and a gruesome, nightmarish reality. The series

                                    Hashirama sought peace for the shinobi world, and to that end

                                    Hashirama and his brothers grew up on the battlefield waging
                                    constant war with the
                                    Senju's rivals: the Uchiha.

                                    three years after the end of the Kira case, Near is shown to have

                                    In the early ’70s, anime was still gaining a foothold as a legitimate and profitable
                                    form of entertainment.
                                    It was still largely seen as a vehicle for either dramatic stories, or children's
                                    tales, but Lupin brought adult comedy anime into the forefront. Although his
                                    adult-oriented themes took a while to catch on, eventually his lecherous antics and
                                    suave handling of epic heists brought grown-ups firmly into anime and proved to
                                    Japanese studio execs that this kind of title could make them money. From Rome, to
                                    Paris, to Rio, Lupin traveled far and wide in search of booty… both kinds.
                                    It was Lupin's love of women and his dirty mind that provided much of the comedy in
                                    the series, and it was the first time racy humor found itself in popular anime.

                                    But the most beautiful part of the anime version of Lupin is that he's much more
                                    chivalrous than his manga counterpart.
                                    The anime version of the character was much more appropriate for the times and fir
                                    his role as a leading man of anime.

                                    Temari is one of the main supporting characters in the Naruto anime and manga series
                                    and the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime and manga series.

                                    She is a jōnin-level kunoichi of Sunagakure and one of the three Sand Siblings.

                                    Temari is the eldest child and only daughter of the Fourth Kazekage, and the older
                                    sister of Kankuro and Gaara.
                                <p>
                                    Temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not
                                    being afraid to speak her mind. One of the few things shown to intimidate her is her
                                    younger brother Gaara. She very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding
                                    attitude, when around the boy, due to the fear of Gaara's wrath. Temari does have a
                                    caring side, and is not above showing concern for others. She is often seen with
                                    Shikamaru. Temari is a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's strategies
                                    and weaknesses soon after a battle begins. For actual combat she uses her giant iron
                                    fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide upon in
                                    order to intimidate her foes.
                                    Sometime after The Fourth Shinobi War, Temari marries Shikamaru Nara and gave birth
                                    their first and only son, Shikadai.
                                    She is voiced by Romi Park in the Japanese version of the anime who also voiced
                                    Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist, Tōshirō Hitsugaya, from Bleach. and by Tara

                                    anime franchise, Naruto, created by Masashi
                                    Kishimoto. In the anime and manga,
                                    Shikamaru is a ninja affiliated with the village

                                    is portrayed as a lazy
                                    character, unwilling to apply his prodigious
                                    intelligence.

                                    Shikamaru Nara is one of the smartest characters in
                                    the anime manga series Naruto.
                                    Masashi Kishimoto originally created Shikamaru in
                                    order for him to be the only
                                    winner of an early Naruto arc: the Chunin Exams,
                                    based on his high intelligence.
                                    However, recommendations from his editors resulted
                                    in Kishimoto deciding to
                                    interrupt the fighting tournament between the ninjas
                                    in order to focus on a recently
                                    introduced villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless,
                                    Shikamaru ends up becoming the only
                                    ninja from the original test to achieve a higher
                                    rank during Part I of the series.

                                    dark green gi, an orange belt,

                                    Trunks is born in November of Age 766 to Vegeta and
                                    Bulma, thus making him a Saiyan
                                    and Human hybrid, like Gohan. He was an illegitimate
                                    child due to the fact that he
                                    was conceived as a result of a brief affair between
                                    his parents. In his infancy, he
                                    was well-loved and doted on by his mother, but it
                                    appeared as if his father had
                                    little to no parental emotions towards the boy due
                                    to the former never wanting to
                                    have children and viewing hybrids as a disgrace.
                                    However, after the end of the Cell
                                    Games, the relationship between his parents improved
                                    and they got married, and they
                                    began raising Trunks as a family.

                                    Rudeus is a tall (175cm), well-built, and
                                    cool-looking man. He was born with brown hair, but
                                    after his second encounter with Orsted, his hair
                                    temporarily became white. His eyes are also slightly
                                    mismatched as he switched both of his eyes out for
                                    demon eyes. Like Paul, he also has a mole underneath
                                    his left eye.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Because of his former life, he is careful not to get
                                    carried away and become arrogant. As a result, he is
                                    extremely self-aware and humble because he does not
                                    want to revert to his old self. He is a kind person,
                                    helping his friends and protecting his family
                                    whenever needed. Due to being capable in many
                                    fields, people have high expectations of him. Rudeus
                                    is very polite to others, often making them
                                    uncomfortable.

                                    Kakashi Hatake is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake
                                    clan. Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan , he is one
                                    of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to
                                    for advice and leadership despite his personal
                                    dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team
                                    7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he
                                    himself received this lesson, along with the
                                    Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha.
                                    After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes
                                    Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage,
                                    literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).

                                    Kakashi became a Jonin and was sent on a mission
                                    along with Obito and Rin, They where to destroy a
                                    bridge that was being used by enemy forces to enter
                                    Konoha and therefore help in the third great shinobi
                                    war effort. But disaster struck when Rin was taken
                                    by two Iwagakure Jonin. Obito wanted to rescue his
                                    teammate; But Kakashi said that the mission came
                                    first. Kakashi found himself in the same situation
                                    as his father had been in the past and did not want
                                    to make the mistakes that his father had. Obito
                                    disagreed and left Kakashi not before telling him
                                    that what his father did in the past made him a hero
                                    not a disgrace.

                                    antagonist of the series. He is the older twin brother of Nina Fortner (formerly

                                    saved from death by Dr. Kenzo Tenma. Because of this, he is very grateful to Dr.

                                    gifts to cruelly manipulate and corrupt others, often with no apparent end other
                                    than to cause suffering and destruction for his pleasure. His original goal, as he
                                    states when he is young, was to be the last one standing at the end of the world,

                                    erase himself from the world and commit the perfect suicide.

                                    Ever the reluctant fighter, Vash was a living contradiction. He's gifted with
                                    superhuman fighting abilities, but also a superhuman capacity for compassion and
                                    kindness. He's a character who suffered countless scars and wounds to his own body
                                    to protect others, even the very villains he was trying to stop, and his vow to
                                    never take a life provides plenty of drama in Trigun as his enemies use his virtue
                                    against him.

                                    Vash is called "the humanoid typhoon" because utter destruction tends to follow him
                                    wherever he goes, and there's a huge bounty on his head. But in reality, he's
                                    humanity's secret guardian angel on the distant, wild planet of Gunsmoke. As a
                                    "Plant," he's a being with power that few can comprehend. He's the greatest gunman
                                    on the planet, and all the criminals he faces don't stand a chance against him. But
                                    Vash's true challenge is in saving the world from his "brother" Knives, and it's
                                    this conflict that brings out Vash's real heroism. The tale of Vash's childhood and
                                    his mother figure Rem is a great story, as is the story of how Knives ended up being
                                    the polar opposite of Vash. Although Vash is often portrayed as a childish goofball,
                                    in reality he's a very complex and tortured character who is doing his best to save
                                    people who never even know what he's done for them.

                                    shrunken form.
                                    Shinichi took the appearance of his six or seven-year-old self after being exposed
                                    to a prototype poison
                                    called APTX 4869, which he had been forced to swallow by two men in black later
                                    revealed to be members of
                                    the Black Organization. The poison de-aged Shinichi's entire body except for his

                                    he still has the personality, memories, and incredible deductive ability of his

                                    the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him. He also spends a good amount

                                    Restaurant Yukihira. He is a 92nd Tōtsuki Generation alumnus and a former resident
                                    of
                                    Polar Star Dormitory. He is also a previous 1st seat of the Elite Ten Council

                                    Sōma's main outfit is his Restaurant Yukihira cooking uniform, consisting of a black
                                    shirt with the restaurant's logo on the back and left chest area of his shirt.
                                    Whenever
                                    he cooks, he wears a white apron over his waist. While at Tōtsuki, Sōma wears a
                                    black
                                    coat summer school uniform over his Yukihira cooking uniform. Sōma also ties his
                                    trademark white headband around his forehead whenever he cooks. If he is not cooking
                                    or
                                    bathing, he wears his headband around his left wrist. Compared to his fellow Tōtsuki
                                    students, Sōma dresses very casually; in his free time, he sports a hanten jacket
                                    with a
                                    simple white shirt beneath it and a striped track pants at his places of residence.
                                    Sōma
                                    states that dressing in his hanten calms him down.

                                    Anthy Himemiya (also known as Himemiya Ansh) is a mysterious girl who is considered
                                    to be a girl who has no ideas or desires other than what her current master expects
                                    of her. She often becomes the subject of other characters' fury because she tends to
                                    act like a "doormat" and take what they want or desire. Her personality alternates
                                    between unselfish love, passive-aggressive revenge, and taught helplessness. Her
                                    past and present selves are tragic and spiteful. Anthy, like Utena Tenjou, both
                                    defies and fits the preconceptions that she represents as both a princess and a
                                    witch.

                                    Anthy seems to be South Asian and perhaps of Indian ancestry. She wears a bindi mark
                                    or jewel and is notably darker than the others.

                                    was an Imaginary Demon, though in truth was a human sorcerer, and other sorcerers
                                    gave their all to defeat him. After his death, he became a cursed spirit, and his
                                    curse was too strong for his body to be fully destroyed.

                                    traversed the ages as cursed objects, ever growing in power. In the present, Sukuna
                                    has been incarnated into Yuji Itadori due to the latter eating one of his cursed

                                    Hyakkimaru (百鬼丸) is the central character of Tezuka's best known samurai story, Dororo. 
                                    A powerful warrior, Hyakkimaru is travelling on a long quest to retrieve 48 parts of
                                    his body which were sold to demons by his father at his birth. This is a very dramatic
                                    adventure series, with a great variety of unusual mythological creatures and demons,
                                    as well as bandits and other fierce foes. Gradually the grim experiences of his travels
                                    make Hyakkimaru more and more distant and grim, so as he recovers more and more of his
                                    human body he becomes at the same time less and less human. He is accompanied on his harsh
                                    journey by a young orphaned thief named Dororo.

                                    younger brother due to being the firstborn child.About one or two decades later, he returns 
                                    to the village of his birth and is reunited with Dororo.

                                    clan and a direct descendant of the Hyūga clan through his mother. While initially

                                    comes to respect his father and duties. Regardless, he vows to instead become a

                                    isn’t afraid to share them, even in the face of “authority”.

                                    Akaza from Demon Slayer is perhaps the best-written villain in the series.

                                    He is exceptionally polarizing in the fandom.

                Shota Aizawa (相あい澤ざわ消しょう太た Aizawa Shōta?), also known as the Erasure Hero: Eraser Head (イレイザー・ヘッド Ireizā Heddo?), is a Pro Hero and the homeroom teacher of U.A. High School's Class 1-A.Shota is a slender and tall, pale-skinned man with messy, shoulder-length black hair, that partially hangs in front of his face and half-opened black eyes. He is usually recognized for his worn-out appearance,[1][2] often looking fatigued. His facial hair is almost always in a stubbly, unkempt state (unless he needs to look good for the press), and his eyes tired and flat, unless he's in combat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shota is a very stern and reserved man who has lofty expectations of his students. He is primarily motivated by logic and does not believe in the necessity to maintain a clean-cut appearance or filter his words or ideas for others. He often comes off as cold, apathetic, and impatient, exerting very little energy in most situations, preferring to take naps in his sleeping bag instead.Shota has proven to be very vocal and unafraid when expressing his ideas. He has mentioned on several occasions that some of U.A.'s choices when it comes to examinations are not practical or challenging enough for real Hero hopefuls and is adamant about having certain systems used by the institution changed.[10] He also blatantly stated that he did not believe Izuku Midoriya could become a hero when they first met.[3] He is also known for lying to his students in order to manipulate them into giving their best, a technique he describes as a 'logical ruse'/'rational deception'.

                                    particular praise given for its cuteness, and has come to be regarded as an icon of
                                    Japanese pop culture.

                              Inosuke is a young man of average height and pale complexion with an extremely toned and muscular build for his age, possessing large, defined muscles most notably over his stomach and arms. In sharp contrast to this, he has an incredibly pretty and feminine face,[3] with large, wide eyes that are framed by an array of long eyelashes, their irises a dark to soft pale green, thin eyebrows and what could be a small, well-mannered mouth. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Inosuke is an extremely short-tempered and proud young man who always likes to think he is the strongest fighter in a situation, constantly challenging most people he comes across and wanting others to respect and praise him for his skill. This often leads him into unnecessary danger.

                                Jolyne is a young woman of above-average height and a slim to athletic build.
                                Bold-eyed, she wears her hair in two "layers": A dark base including two large buns atop her head 
                                and a short length going down her neck; above which, lightly dyed or bleached, she keeps a plait 
                                or braid that winds around both buns, joining in a short length at back, and bangs that frame her 
                                face. 
                            </p>

                                Like all other members of the Joestar family, Jolyne has a small, star-shaped birthmark on 
                                the rear of her left shoulder, close to her neck. She also has an image of butterfly wings tattooed 
                                on the top of her left forearm, superimposed with a downward-pointing dagger, which also appears on 
                                the chest of her outfits.
